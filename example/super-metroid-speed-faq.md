SUPER METROID
Speedrun Guide
100% (KPDR) & Any% (KPDR, PRKD)
Version 3.0 by NeoChozo

# 1. Control Overview:

Super Metroid was originally released on the Super Nintendo (SNES), however it
has been made available on most modern Nintendo consoles through emulation and
is currently available via Nintendo Switch Online. The core mechanics of the
game do not change from each iteration to the next and control features remain
the same. Super Metroid does, however, allow you to customize the controls,
which is a good thing considering the default controls are awful. You can create
any control scheme you wish, but it is important to note that if you switch any
option to one of the shoulder buttons like L or R, then the corresponding other
button functionality will also switch to Off and be unusable, so if you do like
I used to do and map Dash/Run to L, then R has to be manually changed back to
Angle Down and the Angle Up option will not be usable. Many speedrunners use
combinations of the default controls with a claw grip (meaning you have) but I
personally find this cumbersome. What I have listed below is the control scheme
I tend to use most.

CONTROL PAD:     Move Samus left or right, Use Morph Ball
START:           Pause, Map Screen (+L), Inventory (+R)
SELECT:          Item Cancel
L BUTTON:        Angle Up
R BUTTON:        Angle Down
Y BUTTON:        Fire Beams or Missiles, Set Power Bombs (Morph Ball mode)
X BUTTON:        Item Select
A BUTTON:        Jump, Space Jump, Screw Attack
B BUTTON:        Run/Dash

different runners, go here: https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Control_Schemes


# 2. Game Overview:

Super Metroid was the only 16-bit adventure for Samus Aran, and at the time of 
the game's release, was the largest SNES game with a 24 megabit (a whopping 3MB)
cartridge size. The game itself is an expansive title, and provides countless
hours of replay value just to explore all of the nooks and crannies that the
planet Zebes provides. This game expands Samus' inventory from the last game, 
although the Spider Ball is absent. This time around, the various beam weapons
stack on top of each other and you can freely disable them at will, so you no
longer have to switch beams and then go back to grab them a second time. Samus
now has upgraded Morph Ball and Bomb capabilities along with new suits, better
visors and a grappling item. 30 years after this game's release, people are
still playing it and still uncovering ways to get through it faster than ever.

The planetary environment is much larger than previous games, but the overall
interconnectedness of the map is grandiose in scale. Familiar areas like Brin-
star and Norfair return (along with Kraid and Ridley), but this time there are
additional areas never before seen on Zebes. These areas will test your abil-
ities and equipment like no other Metroid game before it (although let's be
honest, there are only three games at this point), and hardly anything in the
game breaks if you do things out of order, which makes speedrunning the game
all the more fun. Super Metroid was a significant step forward for this game
franchise and it laid the groundwork for many things seen in later installments
of the series.


# 3. Power Suit Upgrades:

The Power Suit is an advanced Chozo exoskeleton that the Chozo modified for
Samus Aran specifically. It has a modular nature that allows for new equipment 
to be added as needed. This section will quickly cover the items that you will
find on Zebes that don't fall into the classification of weapons, which will be
described in the following section.

## Suit Upgrades

You can find specialized Armor Enhancements that increase your defensive cap-
abilities, mobility, and reduce the damage that you take from enemies and the
environment.

 - VARIA SUIT
This is an extra layer of armor that increases your defensive capability
by reducing damage by 50%. Its dense structure also allows you to survive
in the heat of Norfair without damage.

 - GRAVITY SUIT
This is an extra-dense layer of armor that increases defensive power, can
further reduces damage by an extra 25%, and allows unhindered movement in
water and regular lava. It will not protect against the boiling lava that
is found in Lower Norfair and Tourian.

## Boot Upgrades

Part of your power is your agility and jumping prowess. With these special
Chozo upgrades, your mobility is greatly enhanced.

 - HI-JUMP BOOTS
This upgrade adds a special thruster to your Boots that will dramatically
increase your jumping height, allowing you to reach new areas.

 - SPACE JUMP
This upgrade adds specialized thrusters to your Power Suit that allow you

to continuously spin jump in the air. Using this, you can remain airborne

and reach new heights.

 - SPEED BOOSTER [causes 500 damage on contact]
This upgrade adds special powers to your Boots that allow you to run at
high speed. After charging it, you will blaze through enemies and obstac-
les and only stop once you reach something you can't break through. You 
can hold a charge in this form and use the stored energy to fly through
the air at incredible speed.

## Miscellaneous Upgrades

These are the other ancillary Chozo upgrades you will gain that augment the
capabilities of your Power Suit.

 - MORPHING BALL
This upgrade changes your Suit into a compact, mobile sphere. Like the 
Varia, it is modular and able to accept numerous modifications to its 
structure. Press Down twice to activate this feature.

 - BOMB [60 damage per Bomb; 300 total for Bomb Spread]
This is your default weapon for the Morph Ball that allows you to use the
Y Button (or whatever you have mapped to Fire) when morphed. You can have
up to three at a time unless you use the Charge Beam to activate a Bomb 
Spread. These can be used to destroy certain kinds of rock or metallic 
structures, and you can use them to propel yourself to new heights.

 - SPRING BALL
This upgrade adds jumping capability to the Morph Ball. Press B to jump, 
and hold the button down to bounce up and down.

 - SCREW ATTACK [2000 damage on contact]
This upgrade transforms your spin jump into a buzzsaw of destructive en-
ergy. You can use this in tandem with the Space Jump to create a spinning
and unstoppable energy force. Only the strongest enemies can resist the
effects of this weapon. 

 - GRAPPLING BEAM [50 damage per hit]
This upgrade allows you to swing back and forth from special [+]-shaped
icons or certain enemies in the environment. Select the Grappling Beam,
then press Y to fire at an icon and stay connected. Some Grapple Points 
are damaged and crumble after a few seconds.

 - X-RAY SCOPE
This upgrade changes what you can see in the visible spectrum by reveal-
ing hidden passageways, block types and other structural anomalies.

## Energy Upgrades

These items include the health reserves you can find on the planet that help
ensure your continued survival.

 - ENERGY TANK
There are 14 Energy Tanks scattered throughout the environment. These 
will increase the power level available to your Suit's defensive screens.
Each Energy Tank increases your Suit's energy by 100 units. You can fully
recharge your Energy Tanks at refill stations as well as your Ship.

 - RESERVE TANK
These are specialized emergency energy reserves that you can find. They
be set to be used automatically or manually, and act as an emergency 
supply, but they have to be manually filled up (like the Sub Tanks in the
Mega Man X games). There are four total in the game.


# 4. Weapons & Techniques:

Your weapons make up the bulk of the combat in this game. Your Arm Cannon is
capable of firing regular beam-based weapons, energy-based concussive weapons,
and you can increase the range and yield of your Bomb-based weapons.

## Beam Weapons

The Beam System in this game uses a stacking system - in other words, when
you acquire a new Beam, all the effects of previous beams are also included
in the new upgrade unless you disable one from the inventory screen. The 
damage ratios provided list the normal amount of damage, how much it inflicts
uncharged for normal combinations assuming you're stacking the beams and then
leaving them stacked, and finally how much damage each charged version will
inflict. Plasma gives a differential variation for the Ice since it isn't
always equipped during a speed run.

 - POWER BEAM
[causes 20 dmg on contact]
This is your default Beam Weapon that has a fairly slow rate of fire. You
can have up to three shots on the screen at once, and overall is fairly
weak.

 - CHARGE BEAM
[adds +80 damage to all normal beam shots]
This power-up allows you to store energy in your Arm Cannon for a larger
and more powerful burst.

 - SPAZER
[Normal: 40 damage | Charge: 120]
This upgrade widens the radius of your shot by transforming your standard
energy bullet into a tri-beam spread. Charging it up increases the size
of the beams. You cannot equip this at the same time as the Plasma Beam.

 - WAVE BEAM
[Normal: 50 damage | Charged: 130 | w/ Spazer: 70 | Charge w/Spazer: 200]
This upgrade adds electrical disruption capability to your Beams and will
allow your shots to travel through walls. Without any other beam weapons
equipped, your shot travels in a wavy pattern. Charging it up increases 
the size of your Beam.

 - ICE BEAM
[Normal: 30 damage | Charged: 110 | w/ Wave+Spazer: 100 | Charge w/ Wave
+Spazer: 300]
This upgrade turns your Beam into a freezing shot. You can freeze enemies
in their tracks or use them as platforms. Charging it up increases the 
size of your Beam. 

 - PLASMA BEAM
[Normal: 150 damage | Charged: 230 | w/ Wave: 250 | Charge w/ Wave: 750
w/ Wave+Ice: 300 | Charge w/ Wave+Ice: 900]
This upgrade turns your Beam into a powerful laser that will cut through
almost any kind of armored enemy. Charging it up increases the size of 
your Beam. You cannot equip this at the same time as the Spazer. Adding
Ice to this combination inflicts 300 dmg regularly; 900 dmg charged.

 - HYPER BEAM [causes 1000 dmg; cannot be charged]
This upgrade is gained when the Baby Metroid steals the Mother Brain's
power and gives it to you. This replaces all of your Beams and will cut
a swath through anything you fire it at.

## Other Weapons

There are three other types of weapons you can acquire in the game that add
concussive power to both Missiles and Bombs.

 - MISSILE [100 damage]
Missiles allow you to fire small energy-based concussive projectiles at
enemies and objects. Red Doors can be opened with 5 Missiles or 1 Super
Missile. Your Missiles can be upgraded by finding additional Tanks.

 - SUPER MISSILE [300 damage]
These powerful Missile upgrades are worth the power of three Missiles
and can be used to open Green Doors or bypass Super Missile obstructions.
Like with Missiles, your supply can be increased by finding extra Tanks.

 - POWER BOMB [200 damage x2 for enemies; no damage to bosses except Ridley]
This is the strongest Morph Ball weapon and can destroy many different
kinds of structures, harm enemies in the blast radius, and open yellow
doors. You can collect additional Tanks to increase your Power Bomb
supply.

## Special Techniques

The game includes specialized techniques that you can perform using the weap-
ons provided to you. Below are descriptions of these special abilities.

 - BEAM SHIELDS / CHARGE COMBOS
This is a trick that is programmed in the game, but you are never really
instructed on how to do it. Each Shield requires the corresponding Beam 
plus the Charge Beam to activate. First arm your Power Bombs, then go to 
your inventory and select only the Charge Beam and one other Beam. Return

to the game and charge up, then release to activate the shield. Each of
these Bomb Shields consumes a single Power Bomb, but they have the nice
effect of inflicting 1000 dmg per hit.

 - SPAZER SHIELD:  Two tri-shaped projectiles shoot upwards and then rain
down sparks for a short time. This one has been joking-
ly named by the community the "golden shower".
 - ICE SHIELD:     Four large ice snowflakes rotate continuously around
until they strike a target. After striking an enemy, a
snowflake will disappear, and after the 20th repetition
of the sound effect, remaining snowflakes will shoot
off in their respective direction.
 - WAVE SHIELD:    Four small balls will oscillate in an X-shaped pattern
around you if you stand still, but once you move they 
will oscillate instead in a wave pattern. This is a 
trick employed in runs and is commonly referred to as 
an "X-Factor".
 - PLASMA SHIELD:  Four large green plasma orbs will start to spin in a 
clockwise pattern that first rotate out, then in, then 
fly off across the screen in a circular attack.

 - WRAPAROUND SHOT
This specific type of shooting trick employs using a shot that travels
off the map and "wraps around" to the other side. How the wraparound will
work depends on the direction the shot travels as well as the layout of
the room, so there is no exact science behind it. But the most commonly-
used version of this trick is done in Crateria, to use a shot that goes
diagonally down-right just to the left of the upper-right Power Bomb
door to travel through the collision and open the door at the far left
that leads to the Gauntlet.
A more helpful explanation as well as tutorials for this shot glitch are
here: https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Wrap-around_Shot

 - CRYSTAL FLASH
This is a highly advanced move also already in the game that you can use 
to recharge your entire energy complement if you meet certain conditions.

To trigger it, you must be at 51 units of energy or lower, your Reserve 
Tanks must be empty, and you must possess at least 10 Missiles, 10 Super 
Missiles, and 11 Power Bombs (the maneuver itself consumes those amounts
of ammo, and you need the 11th to start the move). To pull it off, first
select the Power Bomb icon and then morph. Hold Down along with L & R,
then detonate the Power Bomb and keep holding all the buttons including
the shot button. After a few seconds, you will be engulfed in energy from
the Power Bomb and your energy will be restored. As a graphical bonus, 
you will see Samus outside of her Power Suit during the animation. This 
is not employed during 100% runs, but is used liberally in both Low% and 
RBO (reverse boss order) runs. For now, Low% and RBO are outside the 
scope of this guide.


# 5. The Planet Zebes:

Metroid games have always been focused on exploration, and this one is certain-
ly no exception. Within this game lie twisting tunnels and mazes that challenge
your sense of direction in many ways. Much of this game is spent looking high 
and low for different passages (although this in of itself might be more of a 
sequence-breaking mentality), bombing obstacles out of the way, and looking for
the most efficient way out of an area. What you'll find below is a brief list 
of some things to consider that will make your journey through Zebes easier.

## Areas of Zebes

You'll travel through six different areas on Zebes during the course of the 
game. All of the areas interconnect through the use of elevator transports. 
Some areas, though, cannot be explored until you have acquired certain items
or upgrades.

 - CRATERIA
This is the surface area of the planet that contains pathways to the old
Space Pirate Base as well as the Wrecked Ship. Your Gunship will always
be located on the surface area, which you can use at any time to reload
ammunition, replenish energy, and save.

 - BRINSTAR
This subterranean area has three distinct regions: the upper jungle area,
the eastern cave area, and the lower crustal area that leads to Maridia.
Kraid, one of the Space Pirate generals, has established a base in the
southeastern area.

 - NORFAIR
This fiery area has two distinct regions - the upper rocky area and the
lower region which has some of the strongest creatures on the planet. The
other Space Pirate general, Ridley, has established his stronghold near
the planet's core.

 - WRECKED SHIP
Millennia ago, an alien crew crash-landed on the planet and succumbed to
some unknown fate. What remains of their ship lies partially submerged in
the eastern area of Crateria. This technologically advanced area has been
taken over by a large spectral entity named Phantoon, and also contains
a pathway to the eastern-most area of Maridia.

 - MARIDIA
This aquatic area has both dry and wet terrain features. Some of the
hardier creatures reside here, and the strongest areas are guarded by the
large creature known as Draygon.

 - TOURIAN
Space Pirates have reestablished their base of operations on the planet 
in a new location. They have also revived Mother Brain, and are working
to continue harvesting Metroids for their ultimate military weapon.

## Travel Methods

Moving around within individual areas is accomplished via doors, gates, or 
tunnels. Moving between areas of the planet, though, is accomplished via the
elevator systems. Below is a short list of the ways you'll be traversing the
planet.

 - BLUE DOOR
These are standard doors, and can be opened with any Beam or Bomb.

 - BLUE GATE
These are like blue doors. Fire at the blue gem to open them.

 - RED DOOR
These doors can only be opened by using 5 Missiles or 1 Super Missile.

 - GREEN DOOR
These doors can only be opened with the use of a Super Missile.

 - GREEN GATE
These are like green doors. Fire at the green gem to open them.

 - YELLOW DOOR
These doors are resistant to all weaponry except Power Bombs.

 - LOCKED DOOR
These cannot be opened until a certain objective has been completed.

 - ELEVATOR
These connect areas of the planet. Activate them by pressing Down.

 - MORPH BALL TUNNEL
These narrow passages allow you to reach new areas by rolling into the
Morph Ball. Some tunnels are blocked by destroyable objects.

## Power-Up Stations

There are various consoles you will find that can aid your progress in some
form or another.

 - MAP STATION
These will allow you to download an entire copy of an area map. Plug into
the console to download the data and open your subscreen to view the map.
Areas that you have explored will be colored pink, while unexplored areas
remain blue.

 - SAVE STATION
These will allow you to save your game progress. Step into the capsule
and your game will be saved up to that point, with all energy and weapons
intact. These are marked on the Map Screen with an [S] icon.

 - MISSILE STATION
These will refill your complement of Missiles (not Super Missiles). Plug
into the console to activate it.

 - ENERGY STATION
These will refill all Energy Tanks you have on hand (not Reserve Tanks).
Plug into the console to activate it.

## Obstructions & Hazards

There are many things in Zebes' environment that will hinder your progress.
Some are natural, while others are man-made.

 - WEAKENED BLOCK
These are blocks that can be destroyed by any kind of weapon.

 - CRUMBLE BLOCK
These collapse under your weight.

 - BOMB BLOCK
These can only be destroyed by Bombs.

 - SUPER MISSILE BLOCK
These can only be destroyed with Super Missiles, and are marked with a 
Super Missile icon.

 - POWER BEAM BLOCK
These can only be destroyed with Power Bombs, and are marked with a Power
Bomb icon.

 - BOOST BLOCK
These can only be destroyed with the Speed Booster, and are marked with a

Speed Booster icon.

 - WATER
Falling into water slows you down unless you have the Gravity Suit.

 - HOT ROOM
The air in some rooms of Norfair is dangerous unless you have the Varia.

 - LAVA
There are three kinds of lava - orange, yellow, and red. Orange is found
mostly in upper Norfair and harms you if you don't have the Gravity Suit.
Yellow is found in middle Norfair and some areas of Crateria, is hotter
than regular lava and harms you regardless of your Suit. Finally, red
lava is found in Tourian and harms you just like yellow lava.


# 6. Movement Guide:

At the core of Super Metroid speedrunning is fast and accurate movement. Many
things in the game are acquired out of order and require some advanced movement
tech to get. This section will cover the basics of movement and the tricks used
in a speedrun. For a very detailed video on movement, consult ShinyZeni's Move-
ment Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG02FglyAE4&t=2284s.

 - GENERAL MOVEMENT
Samus is controlled with the directional pad buttons. She walks very slow
but can accelerate to a modest clip with the Run button held down. While
running, you only need to hold the button until Samus reaches max speed,
after which point you can release the button. While running, Samus' jump
speed and distance are heavily influenced by her speed when she left the
ground, so running is the preferred speed of travel whenever possible.
Until you have the Gravity Suit, your movement is heavily restricted in
water and you have little control over jumping (although this can be
influenced positively if doing certain tricks, like a Gravity Jump or
Maridia movement in a reverse boss order run). Basically if you are not
airborne, you should be running at all times. Abuse of the run button is
key to certain tricks like short charging the Speed Booster.

 - ARM PUMPING
Probably the single most important piece of tech you can learn for speed-
running this game is the Arm Pump and a variation of it, called the Zoh-
din Pump. How Arm Pumping works is that every time you press L or R, it
advances Samus' position forward one pixel. Therefore by repeatedly alt-
ernating L and R presses while running, Samus will move faster across a
horizontal surface than she would just running normally. The idea is that
you're moving from L to neutral to R to advance a total of 3 pixels when
ordinarily you'd just advance one. This works on flat or angled surfaces,
but can cause slowdown if you Arm Pump and fall off a ledge since you 
will lose that extra forward momentum. Once this is mastered, this should
become the default form of generalized movement for getting through rooms
where Samus needs to stay grounded. A variation on this called Zohdin 
Pumping is described below.

 - ZOHDIN PUMPING
This variation on Arm Pumping requires that you press L like normal, but
your R presses use a raking motion with your fingernails as if you were
strumming guitar strings. This allows for more R presses than normal 
without the overlaps that occur with normal Arm Pumping. It is useful
mostly in straightaway hallways or areas where you don't need to worry
about being able to press any of the face buttons.

 - STOP ON A DIME
This trick employs using the Angle Up or Angle Down buttons to immediate-
ly stop any forward momentum. You can use it to quickly land (like with a
Ledge Grab) or quickly mount elevator platforms without having to wait
for Samus to slow down and stop.

 - WALL JUMP
The designers gave Samus a new form of movement in this game that allows
you to scale to higher heights by bouncing off of a wall. Even though
this version is not very intuitive, it is probably the best version of
wall jumping in the series next to the kind in Metroid Zero Mission. To
perform a wall jump, spin jump towards a wall and press the opposite
directional button as you brush against it; if done correctly you'll see
Samus' sprite change to one that looks like she's crouching on the wall.
When this happens, press jump again to bounce off in the other direction.
You can bounce back and forth between walls to scale vertical areas, or
chain them together on the same wall as described below. You'll be taught
this move casually from the Brinstar Etecoons.

 - SINGLE WALL JUMP
This variation of the wall jump involves leaping up a single wall. As you
spin jump at a wall and brush against it, tap the opposite directional
button and jump again, but curve the jump back towards the starting wall.
This requires a lot of back and forth pressing of the directional buttons
but can become much faster than regular wall jumping and leads to many
sequence breaking opportunities.

 - QUICK DROP
This trick abuses how stacks of crumble blocks or quicksand works. By
repeatedly alternating your left and right movement so that you're con-
stantly in a turnaround animation, Samus will plummet at near terminal
velocity through them.

 - DAMAGE BOOST
Damage boosting is a form of movement that allows you to take advantage 
of the knockback from an enemy or damage source and turn that into mom-
entum. While taking damage, press Jump and the opposite directional 
button from where Samus is facing, so if you’re facing left when you take
the hit, press right and Jump to be thrown a sizeable distance. Once the
damage boost has been initiated, hold the direction you’re traveling in 
for a little bump in momentum and distance. This technique is used to 
cross many areas, like getting through Hellway as an example. What you 
damage boost off of requires different kinds of timing; if you’re using 
spikes you have 10 frames to initiate the damage boost, while enemies 
themselves only give you 5 frames, so you will need to plan your button 
presses accordingly. 

 - KAGO'ING
Kago’ing is a trick named after the Craterian Kagos since it is the enemy
this trick was first utilized on. This trick involves performing an unin-
terruptable animation (like an Arm Pump or a turnaround) to pass through 
enemies and objects without experiencing knockback when taking damage or 
using a damage boost. This is the basis for the Zebetite Skip and allows 
Samus to also get through the spiked platforms in Wasteland (Ridley’s 
Lair) and ironically, the platforms in the room leading to Wave Beam as 
you can accidentally kago through them if you are turning around while 
trying to land on them.

 - PSEUDOSCREW
Once you have the Charge Beam, you can spin jump while charged to sort of
mimic a Screw Attack. This technique will inflict 200 damage to any enemy
you touch but only works against most weaker enemies. Bosses and higher
level enemies in Ridley's Lair and Tourian are not affected.

 - SPEED BOOST JUMP
This is merely a spin jump executed from a Speed Boost. You will travel
much farther and much faster, while at the same time inflicting 500 dam-
age to anything you hit during the jump.

 - SHINESPARK
Once you gain the Speed Booster, you also have access to a new movement
tool called the Shinespark. Casual players will learn this from the agile
Dachora in Brinstar, and it involves pressing the Down button during a
Speed Boost to store the energy that can be released in a large kinetic
burst that sends you flying in any of five directions (left, right, up,
diagonally left or diagonally right). Once charged, you will have three
seconds to initiate the Shinespark or you'll lose the charge, therefore
when using these for sequence breaking the resulting movement after a
charge needs to be precise. To execute a Shinespark while grounded, just
store the charge, then press a directional button and jump. If doing it
while in the air, you must first straighten out from a spin jump by 
pressing the Up button, then pressing a direction and jump again. Shine-
sparks must be carefully managed in this game, particularly in Any% or 
Low% routes since the move will drain your health at a rate of 1 unit per
frame (or 60 per second).


# 7. Speedrunning Tricks:

As intended, Super Metroid plays fairly normally. When speedrunning, however, 
there are a number of unintended maneuvers and exploits of intended techniques
that are used to get through the game faster. These will be described in detail
below along with short annotations as to where they are generally used. During
the walkthrough itself, I will not stop to describe trick setups, so you can
refer back to this section to learn the mechanics before employing them in an
actual playthrough. Tricks here are organized alphabetically, to save time in
scanning all of them to find the one you're looking for.

 - BABY SKIP
Just as it sounds, Baby Skip is a way to skip the sequence of being 
grabbed by the Baby Metroid in Tourian. It is almost vital to master this
trick for 100% runs, since the Baby will take much longer to drain 14 
Energy Tanks than it does 3. Baby Skip has many variations, but the most 
consistent is the clockwise “Stashio Skip” method which involves Space 
Jumping clockwise around the Baby Metroid, running forward a bit, Space 
Jumping clockwise again, landing, shooting the debris in front of you, 
then doing another clockwise Space Jump and popping into the next room 
before the Baby grabs you. If the Metroid touches you during the door 
transition, it won’t matter as that will take priority over the grab. 
This saves quite a bit of time and skips needing to refill in the next 
room.
Further information can be found here:
https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Big_Boy_Room#Metroid_Skip

 - BLUESUIT
Bluesuit and its variations used in these runs involve striking something
that interrupts the Shinespark before the actual crash animation occurs. 
The most common way to get a Bluesuit is to kill Draygon with a Shine-
spark, which can be done by short-charging the Speed Booster along the 
ground. Once Bluesuit is attained, Samus will have echoes follow her, but
you will move at normal speed and cannot hold the Run button. The primary
function of a Bluesuit is that you can press Down at any time after this 
to get one free Shinespark, which would be used to Reverse Halfie across 
the Colosseum. Two variants of this trick - the Sparksuit and the Spike-
suit - are covered further down.

 - BOMB LADDER
This trick uses the same mechanics as Infinite Bomb Jumping, but you're
angling the trajectory to travel in a diagonal manner. Start by setting a
Bomb and set the second one before the first one goes off. As you go in 
the air, press Left or Right to move and set a third Bomb. Fall into the 
second Bomb, and keep pressing Left or Right to move diagonally across 
the area. This can be used to cross the Moat without using a Continuous
Water Jump or performing Ocean Fly.

 - CONTINUOUS WALL JUMP
A Continuous Wall Jump, or CWJ, is a wall jump variation used to maintain
the speed of your previous spin jump which allows you to chain two jumps 
together while crossing the top of a platform and doing the second wall 
jump immediately on the other side. The most common usage of the CWJ is 
crossing the Moat in Crateria in PRKD Any% runs since you don’t have the 
Speed Booster yet to do Ocean Fly. Set up a CWJ by starting pushed up 
against the door into the Moat. Shoot, open it, and run through while 
spin jumping on the last frame before Samus enters the water to get the 
right height and distance to clear the center pillar. Grab the Missile 
Tank in here and right after the fanfare ends, continue holding the For-
ward direction and press/hold Jump again to wall jump off the edge of the
pillar, maintaining speed and direction, which clears the entire water 
section. This trick is nearly frame-perfect and requires a lot of pract-
ice to get correctly. Oatsngoats has a good tutorial on the CWJ, which is
available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKBck_F8IVk

 - DOWNBACKS
A Downback is a variation on a Downgrab. In this trick, you can press the
Down and Back buttons sequentially on the D-Pad to also break Samus out 
of the spin animation and still land on a ledge. You will start by press-
ing Down to break the spin, but quickly move your thumb to either Left or
Right (depending on which direction you’re facing). Downbacks seem some-
what counterintuitive, but done correctly you can squeeze through areas 
you couldn’t normally while maintaining vertical speed.

 - GRAVITY JUMP
Although not used in this speedrun route, a Gravity Jump can be used to
clear the Lava Dive room without the Space Jump. To do this you would
enter the large lava pit and press Start to bring up the menu. Just as it
fades to black, press and hold Jump to see Samus' jump animation start.
Remove the Gravity Suit then exit the menu while still holding Jump; when
you return Samus will accelerate upwards at an incredible rate of speed
and a significant height boost, enough to get out and to the entrance to
Ridley's Lair.

 - HALFIE & FULL HALFIE
These two variations on the same trick are used to cross the Colosseeum 
in Maridia right before Draygon. The name's origin is from when the trick
was used to only cross half of the room, and Full Halfie is the modified
version that crosses the entire room. To execute a Full Halfie, start in
the room just after Botwoon, charge the Speed Booster and head into the
next vertical room. Store a Shinespark and quickly single wall jump up
the right-hand wall while performing a good ledge grap or downgrab, open
the door and quickly spin jump out past the overhang and then execute 
a Shinespark to carry you across the room. If you don't get enough height
then the last set of pillars will block you, resulting in a Halfie. This
trick requires immense practice since you only have a 3-second window to
climb the wall, ledge grab, spin jump and spark. A Reverse Halfie is the
term used for crossing the room going back and is accomplished by getting
a Bluesuit from Draygon and converting it into a Sparksuit.

 - INFINITE BOMB JUMP
Everyone knows about infinite bomb jumping as a way to continuously climb
to higher areas by varying the Bomb timing. Not much in this speedrun
requires the use of IBJs, but you can perform them by setting a Bomb and
then setting another one right before that first one explodes. Set the
third Bomb at the peak of the first jump, and then keep this rhythm going
to climb higher and higher. For funsies, it takes exactly 150 consecutive
Bomb Jumps to climb from the bottom of the landing site area to the top
of the screen.

 - LEDGE GRABS / DOWNGRABS
Grabs are performed by landing on platforms a little earlier than intend-
ed. While spin jumping towards a ledge, you can break out of the spin by 
pressing Angle Up or Angle Down after passing over the collision of a 
ledge. This makes Samus immediately break the spin and land on the ledge.
This first variation is the standard “Ledge Grab”. A Downgrab, on the 
other hand, is executed with the same movement style, but you press the 
Down button on the D-Pad during the height of the jump to extend the size
of Samus’ hitbox which can get her on the ledge sooner.

 - MOCKBALL
This is a move that retains your running speed while rolling in Morph
Ball form. Start off running, then execute a spin jump, and right before
you land, hit Down twice and roll your thumb to Forward on the D-Pad. If
you bounce when you hit the ground, you hit Down too late. The goal is
to smoothly hit the ground and continue rolling at the same speed you
were running at.

 - MOONFALL
In the game’s special setting menu, there is an option you can toggle on 
called Moonwalk. This allows Samus to walk backwards while facing the 
same direction when you hold the shot button and the opposite direction. 
It also directly makes this next trick possible. By Moonwalking off of a
ledge and transitioning that into a fall, you have no cap on your falling
speed and it will keep increasing, even allowing you to pass through some
platforms. To perform a Moonfall, first hold L or R depending on the dir-
ection, start a moonwalk, then jump so that Samus releases the shot and 
turns to jump backwards. Keep the spin going and Samus will steadily 
accelerate as she falls. There are numerous areas to use this in a speed-
run; the most common and best place to practice is the Craterian Shaft
just outside of old Tourian.

 - OCEAN FLY
This is a trick to cross both the Moat and the area right before the
Wrecked Ship without the Grapple Beam. To perform this trick, you need to
start in the room prior to the Moat and charge the Speed Booster, then
store a Shinespark. As you enter the Moat, store the Shinespark and use
a running Spin Jump to cross half of the room, then straighten out and
fire a charged Beam or Missile so that it travels and opens up the next
door, then execute the Shinespark to fly through the remainder of the 
room and the entirety of the next room.

 - SPARKSUIT & SPIKESUIT
This Bluesuit variant has two forms that each depend on what you use to
activate it - Sparksuits are triggered by touching electricity and Spike-
suits are triggered after touching spikes. They are highly preferred to
the Bluesuit since you can run freely, hold the Dash button and you will
still have the benefit of a reserve Shinespark. The way you activate them
are fundamentally the same. First, you have to have a Shinespark charged 
or an active Bluesuit. Go to the trap you want to use, then morph and 
touch the sparks or spikes. Unmorph on the frame you take damage (or the 
frame right after), then within 8 or 9 frames (depending on which frame 
you unmorphed on), use the Shinespark and do not hold any directional 
buttons (if it makes more sense, the Shinespark has to be triggered on 
the 10th frame). When done correctly, Samus will kind of freeze in place
while a Shinespark seems to activate, but when you drop you can freely 
run and you'll still have a reserve Shinespark that you can activate any
time by pressing Down.
There are two times in the runs that these tricks are employed: after
defeating Draygon (100% & Any%) and after defeating Crocomire (100%). In
Draygon's room, first get a Bluesuit by killing Draygon with Shinespark,
then trigger the glitch against the electrical traps on the left while
Draygon is dying. In Crocomire Speedway, you perform the trick against
the left-hand spiked wall while Crocomire's roasted skeleton is busy
traveling from right to left for the "gotcha!" cutscene.

 - SPEED BOOSTER SHORT CHARGE
The Speed Booster count only actually increments when Samus’ left foot 
touches the ground during a charge. The first time Samus’ foot hits the 
ground while charging, the counter goes from 0 to 1. At 4, the Speed 
Booster engages. It is possible to shorten the time and distance required
by tapping the Run button only when this happens. You can further reduce 
the amount of distance it takes by stuttering your presses of the Forward
button, which is known as stutter-stepping or super short charging.

 - SPEED BALL
This is more or less a Mockball with the Speed Booster equipped. The keys
for execution are the same, too - press Down in the middle of a Speed 
Jump, and press Down and Forward when you hit the ground to continue your
forward motion in Speed Booster mode. Any enemy struck by this sustains
500 damage, just like the Speed Booster.

 - STANDUP GLITCH
During the Mother Brain fight (in 100% runs or any game where you have
seven or more Energy Tanks), there is a method to break out of the forced
kneeling pose the game puts you in after you get whomped by Mother Brain
and her Hyper Beam. The benefit to this is that during the cutscene where
your energy is being refilled, you can jump and damage Mother Brain with
charged shots, which drastically reduces time spent on the third phase of
the fight. First, you have to have over six Energy Tanks, or at least 700
or more health (not counting your Reserve Tanks) before she uses Hyper
Beam the first time. When she starts to charge, run into her legs repeat-
edly to get yourself between 600 and 700 HP, then let the Hyper Beam hit
you for 300. As soon as you get forced into the kneeling pose, spam the
Up button and damage yourself below 400 HP. The game will check to see
if you can survive another hit and proceed to the next phase if the check
returns a "no". Now when Mother Brain starts to charge the Hyper Beam for
a second time, you want to be airborne, so just Space Jump in place.
The Baby Metroid will fly onto the screen and do its thing. When the Baby
detaches, Mother Brain will be given 36,000 HP for the final phase. Stay
airborne as the Baby Metroid grabs you, then you'll be able to stand up
and jump to fire charged shots at Mother Brain's head. It will take 40
fully charged shots to reduce her to 1HP, and if you're fast you can
probably get about 35 in, leaving only two to three hits of the Hyper
Beam to kill her third phase. This strategy is employed in the 100% run.

 - ZEBETITE SKIP
This trick is used in all runs and skips the Zebetites before fighting
Mother Brain, as they load one after the other. The most common method
involves freezing the Rinkas, then taking damage and using the resulting
invincibility frames to pass through the first Zebetite. To do this, head
into the Zebetite room and land next to the first one. Crouch and hold
Angle Down to shoot where the first Rinka will spawn and freeze it. Spin 
jump towards the Zebetite to take a 0 damage hit that gives i-frames, 
then make a small spin jump to align to the right side of the frozen
Rinka and jump normally while holding Left on the D-Pad to clip through
the Zebetite. Once done correctly, the others will not load, giving you
a free pass to reach Mother Brain unimpeded.


# 8. Speedrun Overview:

As stated in the opening of this guide, this is not a generalized walkthrough of
the game. This is designed as a speedrun guide and it incorporates all of the 
various tricks, skips, and sequence breaks used to clear the game as fast as 
possible, both with getting 100% of the items and with getting the generally 
accepted Any% items (with maybe an extra item or two thrown in there for safety 
reasons). During the 100% walkthrough, explicit directions will be provided for
clearing areas while annotated summaries will be given for the Any% walkthrough 
(as it is being assumed you are not attempting Any% until you have otherwise 
mastered the game). For item tracking purposes, all items are labeled in capital
letters with the item type, the number you have against the total in the game 
(when applicable) followed by a percentage point, i.e. [MISSILE TANK (005/230)
– 2%]. This should help make item tracking a little easier. Additionally, for
the 100% walkthrough, areas will be clearly marked off when you transition from 
one area to another, such as from Crateria to Brinstar.

The Any% section of this guide will follow the two generally-accepted routes for
the game. The first one, KPDR, is the same boss order as 100%, that is Kraid,
Phantoon, Draygon, and Ridley. The faster Any% route which is covered second
switches things up and does the order as PRKD, that is Phantoon, Ridley, Kraid,
and Draygon. The first route is for beginners while the second is for advanced
players since it skips safety items and also doesn't collect Spazer or Plasma.
Any% is usually defined as "whatever the player needs to beat the game", but
since picking up extra items means more time, there is a generally-accepted set
of items to get. In these walkthroughs, the items will still be capitalized and
organized by numbers but percentages will not be tacked on, but for reference
purposes, my KPDR route is 24% and my PRKD one is 20%. In order to complete the 
game, you need a minimum of 15 Missiles and 10 Super Missiles to kill Mother 
Brain’s glass case form and 3 Energy Tanks to survive the Hyper Beam, but both 
of the routes I list here have provisions for extra Missiles just in case a shot
goes awry in Tourian.

Beyond 100% and Any%, there are plenty of other speedrunning categories. At this
time, this guide update is not including a Low% walkthrough because I myself am
simply not practiced enough at the concept to write anything in-depth about it.
The Super Metroid speedrunning wiki has plenty of information related to the
various Low% categories (https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Low%25), as well as the
most commonly run ones in 14% (https://wiki.supermetroid.run/14%25). If this
guide is updated in the future with information, it will likely follow the path
for 14% Ice, as that is the only category I personally have experience with.

A question I often see asked relates to how the game is timed. Super Metroid is
a game generally timed according to RTA (Real Time Attack) standards, which 
means a timer starts upon the start of gameplay and ends when you finish the
game. This is not the case with, say, Metroid Prime, which is timed according
to the in-game timer (IGT). My previous versions of this guide went by IGT 
standards and included placeholders of where you should probably be at any given
time; in this latest revision I have eliminated those. RTA is the truer method
of knowing just how fast you are in the Any% setting, whereas you might consider

IGT more for a 100% run since you aren't timed for things like door transitions
or the item fanfare that you'll hear 100 times. The walkthrough will be divided
into two sections below for 100% and Any% and the timer begins when you first
set foot onto the Ceres Colony. 

## 8A. 100% Route

This walkthrough contains all of the directions for clearing the game with all
100 items in a route based on ShinyZeni's 100% record. The game starts at the
Ceres Colony and follows the KPDR route, focusing on the bosses first and the
Brinstar cleanup last before tackling Tourian. The various speedrunning tricks
will not be described in great detail during this walkthrough since they have
been detailed in Section 7: Speedrunning Tricks. I recommend practicing the
tricks for your chosen run fist before trying to employ them in an actual
speedrun, but while practicing you can either utilize the practice ROM on an
emulator for save states, use save stations if playing on console, or rewind
if playing on Switch Online. As for as generalized movement goes, I will not
be making specific references for Arm Pumping; once you are comfortable with
the technique or the Zohdin variant, you should be using it for all ground-
based movement. The run begins below when you touch down at Ceres.

### Space Colony

As soon as you start the game, position yourself on the right-side of the
elevator pad, moonwalk backwards and spin jump off so that you Moonfall all
the way to the bottom of the room. Unlike all other doors in the game, the
ones on the Colony will react to you getting close, so don't worry about 
having to shoot them. Continue through all of the rooms, including the one
where the Baby Metroid was to reach the room where you'll "fight" Ridley.

#### Boss Battle: Ridley

HIT POINTS: 2000
ATTACKS:    Collision (5 dmg), Fireball (3 dmg), Tail Whip (15 dmg)

Ridley's HP doesn't matter in this fight; you can't kill him anyway. Your
only objective here is to whittle your HP down to less than 30 to force
Ridley to fly away. Stay in the right-hand corner and keep getting struck
by his tail. Once you hit 29 HP, Ridley will fly away and the escape seq-
uence commences.

You have one minute to get out of here, but you should easily be able to 
make it out in less than 20 seconds. Backtrack out of here the way you came,
hoping for good RNG patterns with steam vents. In the large room with the
falling ceiling tiles, you can Damage Boost off of them to get thrown across
the room faster. Once you make it to the first room, use Ledge Grabs with
spin jumps to quickly ascend the platforms leading to the elevator pad. 

Once you escape, you'll follow Ridley back to the planet Zebes and touch 
down on the surface, in an area called Crateria.

### Crateria

As you land on Zebes, you'll exit your ship and emerge on the upper surface 
of the planet. Immediately turn left and head through the blue door. Head to
the pitfall and drop down through it to the blue door located at the bottom
of the tunnel. Drop down into the large shaft that you used to escape from
Tourian in the first game. Here, perform another Moonfall off of the right-
hand side of the platform to quickly speed all the way to the bottom, then
head through the blue door to reach Mother Brain's original chamber. Pass
through this room to reach the next door which leads to an elevator. Take
this path down to reach the blue area of Brinstar.

### Brinstar

Back where it all started. Super Metroid loves throwing nostalgia at you
right off the bat, but we're speedrunning here, so head immediately left
over the high wall to drop down and grab the [MORPHING BALL - 1%], then
spin jump/wall jump up to get back to the other side. Continue all the way 
to the left and go through the blue door. There is a path in the floor along
with another door. Ignore the door and shoot through the floor to reach a 
Morph Ball path leading to another door. Head inside and shoot the orb that
the Chozo Statue holds for the first [MISSILE TANK (005/230) - 2%], then 
exit out of here the way you came. Shoot the upper-left blocks and mid-air
morph into the hole to get up faster, then return and take the elevator
back up to Crateria.

### Crateria

Your trip to Brinstar woke everything up, so your first obstacle will be
clearing five Space Pirates from the Brain's chamber room. Kill all of them
and head back into the Tourian shaft, while using single wall jumps to 
climb the walls. Killing these Pirates isn't necessary to proceed, but you
will want to shoot upwards in between your wall jumps to clear the ones from
the right-hand wall so you can ascend faster. Once you reach the top, go 
back up to the upper level while avoiding the Geemers and the Ripper, then 
roll past the Skrees into a Morph Ball Tunnel. Fall down this passage and
avoid another Ripper, and enter the door at the bottom. Go past the Flicker-
bats and use your Missiles on the red door and go through it to find another
Chozo Statue. Shoot its orb to claim the [BOMB - 3%] upgrade, but you'll 
soon find that it was a trap - an ancient Torizo disguised itself as a Chozo
and now wants to fight.

#### Boss Battle: Silver Torizo

HIT POINTS: 800
ATTACKS:    Collision (8 dmg), Claw (10 dmg), Wave Attack (10 dmg), Bomb 
Spread (8 dmg)

The Silver Torizo (or Bomb Torizo, whichever you want), is an effortless
fight. Morph as the fight starts and stay under its legs. This will force
the Torizo to jump backwards into the right-hand corner. From here, aim up
with your Arm Cannon to fire shots at its head, then straight up when it
fires Bombs from its mouth to get Missile refills. Space out how you grab
the Missile refills so you aren't wasting the pickups, and continue to
pound away at the Torizo's head to finish this fight quickly.

Exit the room after the Torizo is dead and head back two rooms to the Alca-
traz vertical room. Bypass the Ripper, wall jump off the left-hand wall and
mid-air morph into the tunnel on the left to avoid taking the right-hand
loop that requires Bombs. Head left to the farthest wall and Bomb through it
to reach another blue door that takes you to a long diagonal tunnel. Race
down this hallway to claim the [ENERGY TANK (01/14) - 4%] at the end, and
continue through the next door to reach a zig-zagging room with some Space
Pirates. Kill all of them with Missiles and use the blue door on the left
to reach another rocky tunnel area. Clear this room to reach the next blue
door which leads to an elevator to another part of Brinstar.

### Brinstar

This brings you to the green jungle areas of Brinstar. Make your way down 
this shaft and stop at the first red door on the left. Open the door, then 
run in and spin jump, pressing Down and Forward as you land for a Mockball
that gets you underneath the gates. Shoot through the ceiling at the end,
wall jump up and damage boost past the Wavers and Sidehoppers here to reach
the first [SUPER MISSILE TANK (05/50) - 5%] at the end, then damage boost
back across to the right and head back down to open the red door beneath
you. Enter this room and you'll find a Chozo statue holding the first [RES-
ERVE TANK (1/4) - 6%], then roll through the tunnel underneath the statue 
into another room with a [MISSILE TANK (010/230) - 7%]. Once you've collect-
ed it, Bomb the wall directly behind it to clear a path to another [MISSILE 
TANK (015/230) - 8%] and exit back to the room with the statue. Open the 
door and get a running start to do a short hop Mockball to get back across
the room to the other side so you can easily drop down to another [MISSILE
TANK (020/230) - 9%] below a set of crumble blocks. Now exit the room the
way you came in and continue heading down the shaft to the red door on the
right.

In this next long tunnel, jump over the Zeelas and Mockball past the Reos to
reach a wall that you can Bomb through. Get to the other side and bypass the
Metarees as Mockball through the door into the next large open area. Follow 
the winding path around ignoring all the enemies to reach the path at the
very bottom of the room. Ignore the Missile Tank here for now and use Bombs 
to clear a path through the floor to drop down to the Chozo that holds the
[CHARGE BEAM - 10%]. Now climb back up, Bomb Jump over the obstruction and
use the green door to get to another jungle part of Brinstar. This next area
is sloped somewhat downward to the right, so use spin jumps and Mockballs
as necessary to reach the bottom. Shoot the gate with your beam to open it
and head into the next room, where you can shoot some Cacatacs to get re-
fills for any Super Missiles you've used. Run across the Noob Bridge to get
to the other side, and take the door into Red Brinstar.

The Red Tower area has paths leading up and leading down; in this route you
are going to head all the way down. Shoot through parts of the floor to
avoid a Beetom, then fall past the Rippers (you can try for a Moonfall here)
and use the door on the right-hand side to reach an area with some water.
Spin jump over the first half and damage boost off the Skree to get past
the second half to reach another room where you need to shoot through the
ceiling and wall jump up to reach a path that leads to a green door. Head
inside this room to find a Chozo holding the [SPAZER - 11%], then go back
the way you came, bombing through part of the floor. Hold Right as you fall
to not land right on top of the Yapping Maw, then kill the Cacatac and spin
jump across the next water pit to reach the door. Keep going on through the 
next few rooms, past the large glass pipe that leads to Maridia, and you'll
reach the elevator to Norfair. Ignore it for now and fire Super Missiles at
all three blocks on the right-hand wall; doing this is wasteful of ammo for
now but it allows you to make one continuous running jump to reach the plat-
form leading to Kraid. Otherwise you can drop to the stair area on the 
bottom and make a long spin jump to wall jump off the edge, but the first
method is faster. Once you get across, take the blue door leading into the
next area.

### Kraid's Lair

Kraid's Lair is very short and very straightforward. Start off by ignoring
the Zeelas and shoot through the floors to reach a new room with a locked 
door. Bomb through the right-hand wall to expose a tunnel that leads to a 
door in the ceiling, then wall jump up into the door. Defeat the Kihunters 
in this area and shoot a path through the cracks in the floor to expose a 
path leading to a long tunnel. Use your Missiles to quickly eliminate the 
Space Pirates and just run through the spikes flying from off-screen. As you
get towards the door, you'll run into Mini-Kraid, a small version of the 
main guardian himself. Wipe him out with one Super Missile and collect all 
of the refills he leaves behind, then enter the next door. This room has a 
few spikes and and Zebs, as well as the body of a dead Federation Trooper 
(it's probably Houston from the NP comic honestly). Damage boost off the 
spikes to reach the Gadora covering the door and wipe it out with a Super 
Missile, then head inside to trigger the fight against Kraid.

#### Boss Battle: Kraid

HIT POINTS: 1000
ATTACKS:    Collision (20 dmg), Boomerang Claw (10 dmg), Spine (10 dmg), 
Abdominal Spike (16 dmg)

Kraid is a pushover who technically has two phases - one where he's only
partway out of the ground and another where he's fully surfaced. But there
is a trick to stun lock him and kill him in the first phase. As soon as 
Kraid has finished emerging, fire a Missile at his eye and another one
right at his snout, then switch to Super Missiles. Right as he is about to
open his mouth, fire a Super Missile - if it hits correctly this freezes
Kraid in place and you can fire your remaining Super Missiles into his
locked-open mouth to finish him off right here.

Defeating Kraid in this manner will not open up the main screen, so you have
to run to the right and navigate blindly to the door that leads to the next
room. It's not hard - run for about three seconds and spin jump up, then
shoot and you should get it. Enter the next room for the [VARIA SUIT - 12%],
then return back to Kraid's room and it will have loaded properly. Exit the
area the way you came in, stopping by the now-unlocked door near the start.
Enter the room and shoot part of the ceiling to get the [ENERGY TANK (02/14)
 - 13%], then let all of the Beetoms latch onto you and fire a single Missile
upwards to destroy them. Now exit Kraid's Lair.

### Brinstar

Spin jump across the gap, destroy the Super Missile blocks and head on down
to the fiery depths of Norfair.

### Norfair

Once you get off the elevator, drop to the very bottom of this rocky shaft
and take the red door to the left. Run in and grab the [ENERGY TANK (03/14)
 - 14%], then quickly fall through and kill the lone Sova before it travels
down the tunnel. Once its dead, shoot the flashing door that you came in
through, then roll down the tunnel and take the next blue door to reach a
Chozo statue holding the [HI-JUMP BOOTS - 15%]. Exit the room with your new
big girl shoes and take the upper path to find another [MISSILE TANK (025/
230) - 16%], then roll through back to the main part of the room and return
to the rocky shaft. Now climb up and take the first door on the right and 
shoot out part of the floor to reach the bottom. Run past the small Dessgee-
gas as you cross the room, then jump up at the end to reach another door 
that leads to a room with spires and lava valleys. Go past the second one 
and go down into the lava and shoot the lowest part of the rock to reveal a
[MISSILE TANK (030/230) - 17%], then continue on to the end to reach a green
door. The next area is a staggered layout of rock columns. The lava here is
filled with Dragons and Sovas that you can damage boost off of to cross the
room faster. Once on the other side, head into Bubble Mountain, climb up to
the door above you and kill the nearby Waver.

Make a long running spin jump to cross to the area in the middle, then use
two wall jumps to get up and over the Cacatac and cross to the upper path
to the right. Head inside and kill the Skrees, then shoot up through the
ceiling to reach the next door. Run through this entire area down to the
other end and shoot the red door to open it. Before going in, shoot the
ceiling to reveal another [MISSILE TANK (035/230) - 18%], then head into 
the next room to find a Chozo statue holding the [SPEED BOOSTER - 19%]. Now
use the Speed Booster to race all the way back up the room and return to
Bubble Mountain, this time dropping down and right to reach the next door.
Drop down another ledge in here to reach a door leading to a large open
room and carefully but quickly cross the platforms. If you turn around in
mid-air to steady yourself you might accidentally kago right through them,
so be precise with your jumps. Spin jump to the middle ledge, shoot the blue
gate, and start running to collect the [MISSILE TANK (040/230) - 20%], then 
continue that momentum to make a long spin jump across the spikes to the 
other wall and single wall jump to climb up to the red door above you. Head 
into the next room and grab the [WAVE BEAM - 21%], then exit and spin jump
across the spikes again to land on a set of crumble blocks. Roll underneath
the large spire and make a running spin jump right at the middle of the
first raised part of the floor up to the left to hit the ledge right above
the Fune and quickly wall jump up to the door, then return up and back to
Bubble Mountain. Climb up and kill the Cacatac again, then fall down and
shoot the floor out to reveal a Morph Ball tunnel. Travel down it while
killing the two Sovas to reach an area with two doors and take the one on
the left. Run through here and spin jump across the gap, then use Speed
Booster in the next room to crash through the blocks and Beetoms. This will
take you back to the elevator room at the entrance of Norfair, so climb up
and take the green door on the top left.

Go through it and use the Speed Booster to get past the security gates, 
and charge a Shinespark just as you get past the second gate. Open the next
door and Shinespark horizontally through the room, then take the next door
into a zig-zagging room with multiple Funes. Ignore the path you're supposed
to take, instead spin jumping and mid-air morphing into the small hole just
above you. From here, jump again and mid-air morph into the middle tunnel to
reach a path with three Sovas and a door that leads to the [ICE BEAM - 22%].
Grab it and return exactly the way you came, stopping just before the door
going back into the room with the gates. Open the door and quickly perform
a short hop Mockball to get past the gates (if you miss it and it closes,
its closed for good and you have to navigate back and take the intended path
at the top), which takes you back to the elevator area. Take the elevator
back up and head to Brinstar.

### Brinstar

Start running to the left and charge the Speed Booster, storing a Shine-
spark right before the last door that leads to the watery room. Spin jump
across the room to land by the Cacatac, fire ahead to open the door to the
left, then Shinespark across and through the entirety of the next room to
get back to Red Tower. Now single wall jump up the right-hand side of the
wall and freeze the final Ripper to use as a platform, then continue your
climb all the way up. Going further up there is a vertical passage and four
Rippers; freeze them on the way up and use them to climb to the next blue
door. This room is called Hellway and has many Samus Eaters, Yapping Maws,
and Zebbos, so it can be a pain to cross normally. Use the spikes to damage
boost your way across to the right, then take the next door and shoot your
way through the floor. Bypass the Zeros on your way down to reach a green
door at the bottom left and head inside. This room has two sets of Boyons
that you're supposed to freeze; instead spin jump into the first one and
damage boost across the gap to the left to reach a Chozo statue holding 
your first [POWER BOMB TANK (05/50) - 23%], then immediately set one to
blast away the wall behind you to reveal a hidden [MISSILE TANK (045/230) -
24%]. Grab it and damage boost back across the spiked pits using the Boyons
then climb back up past the Zeros to reach another green door. Head inside
and Mockball to the far left, setting a Power Bomb to both destroy the
floor and kill the three large Sidehoppers. Drop into the destroyed Samus
Eater to find a hidden [POWER BOMB TANK (10/50) - 25%], then head back to
the right, damage boosting off the spikes to get back to the previous room.
Climb up and take the elevator back to Crateria.

### Crateria

At the top of the elevator, open the yellow door with a Power Bomb and go
up the platforms past the Geemers. At the top, shoot the ceiling and kill
the two Kihunters in here before opening the door to the right with a Power
Bomb. Now go back left a bit and short charge the Speed Booster, storing a
Shinespark right before the little lip in the ground. Quickly spin jump over
to the right to enter the Moat, then make another quick spin jump, straight-
ening out in the air. Right as you straighten out, fire a charged shot and
execute the Shinespark; the goal here is to have that shot travel as you do
and open up the next door. You'll grab a free [MISSILE TANK 050/230) - 26%]
as you go, and if the trick worked, you'll continue to fly through the now-
open door all the way across the ocean to reach the Wrecked Ship. If your
Ocean Fly attempt didn't work, open the door and use the sloped ground just
ahead of you to short charge the Speed Booster again, then Shinespark across
the ocean; either way you'll reach the green door at the end.

### Wrecked Ship

From the entrance, run down the hallway to reach the next door that will
take you into the main corridor of the Wrecked Ship. At this point, the ship

is without power, so there are no enemies floating about except for Coverns
that sporadically pop up. Head down the vertical area to reach the bottom, 
then morph at the left-hand wall and Bomb through to reach a new area. Cross
the inactive spikes to reach a [MISSILE Tank (055/230) - 27%], then run back
and use a Power Bomb to clear a path through the floor, and navigate the 
tunnels down to the bottom section. There are two cannons on the floor, but 
ignore them and go through the green door on the bottom to reach the lowest 
floor. Go to the right and Bomb through the lower-right corner to expose 
another small tunnel that takes you directly to another Gadora and destroy
it with a Super Missile, then head inside to start the fight against the
ghostly guardian of this area, Phantoon.

#### Boss Battle: Phantoon

HIT POINTS: 2,500
ATTACKS:    Collision (50 dmg), Fireball (20 dmg)

Phantoon can be a difficult fight casually and can be even harder to do
optimally. Phantoon spends most of its time invisible and invulnerable, 
only dropping blue flames that bounce and aren't worth crap for refills.
The objective is to hit Phantoon when he opens his eye, but this can be
a problem since he will always send out a circular wave of flames when he
does. Memorization of Phantoon's possible patterns as well as knowledge
of his eye opening patterns are the key to an optimal fight.

Phantoon starts the fight moving in a figure-8 pattern. In the first round
he will start at top-center and have a 50/50 chance of moving either left 
or right, with RNG mostly determining when he will open his eye. In the 
second and subsequent rounds, he will start at either the top left or top
right before beginning the figure-8 and his left/right choices are adjust-
ed by 0.09% (left is 50.9 and right is 49.1). A fast pattern has him open 
his eye about one second after moving, a medium is about six seconds, and 
slow is about 10 to 11 seconds. Fast and medium rounds have a roughly 25%
chance of occurring; slow rounds have a 50% chance. Obviously, you want 
fast or medium patterns, but you have no control over it. You never want 
to use Super Missiles against Phantoon unless it’s used to score the final
hit, because otherwise he enters a rage state that wastes approximately 20
seconds while he becomes invulnerable, stays at the top of the room, and 
sends out waves of flames that you will need to Pseudoscrew through. 

There are two main ways to kill Phantoon. The fastest way is by using a
trick called the Doppler technique. This trick sort of stun locks Phantoon
because you can cause damage while he attempts to close his eye if you
"stutter step" towards him, meaning you run towards him without constantly
holding the run button. Ordinarily, Phantoon resets patterns after taking 
300 or more damage, but if you hit him as he attempts to close his eye, he
will stop moving and you can continue firing Missiles in a very particular
pattern like a metronome to get in much more damage than normal. Now this
is the method employed in Any% PRKD runs, but since we have Wave Beam in
this route, there is another option using X-Factors (your Wave Beam shield
that uses Power Bombs. Set up the X-Factor so that it hits Phantoon when
his eye is open for 1,000 damage; if you get a slow pattern this ends up
being easier to hit with. Hit him with a second X-Factor, then finish the
fight with a Super Missile since they do double (600) damage to him and 
won't trigger his enraged state if the Super is what kills him. Practice 
is the key here to learning manipulation techniques for an optimal fight.
The speedrun wiki has a ton of information on Phantoon, using dopplers, 
and a metronome video displaying the ideal Missile firing frequency.
https://wiki.supermetroid.run/Phantoon

With Phantoon's destruction, the power is restored to the ship. While this
now means all the doors will work, the enemies also populate the area. Exit
the room and avoid the Atomics as you head back up, then continue your way
up through the Morph Ball tunnel.  Enter the flashing door to get another
[SUPER MISSILE TANK (10/50) - 28%], then exit the room and go across the 
hall where you can Bomb through the wall to expose a new area. Head past the
conveyors and the enemies here to reach a wall, then shoot the Work Robot to
make it move away from the wall and set a Power Bomb to expose a series of 
passages. Mid-air morph into the second one from bottom to get the [SUPER
[MISSILE TANK (15/50) - 29%], then go back to the main corridor and make 
your way to the very top. Power Bomb through the ceiling and keep going up 
while avoiding the Atomics to reach a door in the ceiling. Up here, you have
to take out some Kihunters and Atomics to unlock two doors. Set a Power Bomb
to take out the first wave at the right, then go back and head to the left, 
continuing to take out the enemies. Once they're all gone, shoot the flash-
ing door to unlock it, then backtrack all the way across the Attic to the 
right to reach another flashing door. This next area has a bunch of sparking
traps and Work Robots, but you can jump into the electricity and kago your 
way through the robots to reach the other side faster to pick up a [MISSILE 
TANK (060/230) - 30%]. Now run all the way back across the Attic and take 
the left-hand door to reach the outer area of Crateria again.

### Crateria

This rocky area serves just as a pathway into another part of the Wrecked
Ship. Start by dropping down and cross over to solid ground, then start
running left and charge the Speed Booster. Store a Shinespark and use it
vertically just to the right of the sixth floating platform, and hold Left
while shooting to expose and collect a [MISSILE TANK (065/230) - 31%], then 
drop down and continue to the left. Towards the wall there is a path that
leads down; shoot a block directly below you with a Super Missile, then roll
into the hole and go left to reach another [MISSILE TANK (070/230) - 32%],
then jump and mid-air morph back into the tunnel you came from and go back
up. Go slightly to the right and shoot through another part of the floor to
find another set of tunnels, and take them to the right past the nest of 
Zebbos to reach another door. Head through this cavern of Wavers and Choots
to reach the next door, which takes you back to the Wrecked Ship.

### Wrecked Ship

This takes you to a bridge with a strange Geemer above you. It only appears
if you're in this particular tunnel, and seems to do nothing else. Head into
the next door to reach a long spiked tunnel with Grapple Blocks. You don't
have the Grappling Beam, but this isn't going to stop anyone. Take a running
jump off the ledge and keep making long running spin jumps through the huge
swath of spikes, using your invincibility frames to get speed going. Towards
the end, right near the end of the spikes and the start of the stairs, you 
want to land and set a Power Bomb to blow up stuff below you, then jump and
mprph into the Chozo statue's hand. Take a quick break to rest your fingers 
as the Chozo awakens and marches you back across the spikes into a hidden 
chamber, then set a Power Bomb to blow up the wall to the right. Take this 
hidden path to reach an area with some Work Robots, and if your Power Bomb 
above was set properly, the Chozo statue and the wall will be gone, allowing
you to collect a [MISSILE TANK (075/230) - 33%] floating in the air as you 
charge a Shinespark while running to the right. Shinespark vertically at the
end to fly upwards to a new room, then go left, fall through the crumble 
blocks, and jump across the middle to get the orb holding another [RESERVE 
TANK (2/4) - 34%]. Drop into the middle and alternate Left/Right to Quick 
Drop down the middle shaft, then run back through the room to reach the door
the Chozo statue dropped you in front of. Head inside to grab your shiny new
[GRAVITY SUIT - 35%], and exit the door while holding Right on the pad to 
fall right back onto a platform leading back to the original entrance.

In here, run to the right to reach the main vertical corridor, then head 
down one level to reach another door you skipped previously. Run past the
Bull in the water and take the next door to reach a room with spiked plat-
forms. Cross them as they drop sequentially to reach another vertical area
and head up through the ceiling to reach a red door. This takes you to a
large watery area with platforms to the left and multiple Skulteras in the
water below. Cross the platforms and use single wall jumps against the left-
hand wall to climb up to a Chozo statue with an [ENERGY TANK (04/14) - 36%].
You can actually get this right after Phantoon without the Gravity Suit, and
it does save a bit of time not backtracking, but the water makes some parts
difficult and actually getting to the ledge requires a precise Bomb Ladder
trick to boost yourself over to the left. Once you have it, return back down
the way you came and exit out to the ocean area.

### Crateria

Drop into the water and run along the ground all the way to the left. At the
end, shoot through the wall, then jump and mid-air morph into a small hole
to reach a hidden room containing a [MISSILE TANK (080/230) - 37%]. Now exit
and climb back up, short charging the Speed Booster as you run to the left. 
Just as you enter the Moat again, make a long speed jump across to reach the
other side, and continue along the path back through this room to reach the
left-hand side of the landing area. Speed Boost through the blocks and take
a moment to recover energy/ammo and save if you wish at your ship. What 
follows next is a brief little item-gathering quest as you return through
Brinstar towards Maridia.

From your ship, run left then turn around and charge a Shinespark. Use it
on the left-hand side of your ship to travel diagonally up-right to land on
a very high ledge. Go slightly down the incline, open the Power Bomb door,
then go back and short charge a Shinespark. Go into the next room and sail
horizontally across the gap to reach a [POWER BOMB TANK (15/50) - 38%], then
go back out to the inclined area. Here, you'll perform a quick little glitch
called a Wraparound Shot where you fire a charged beam to the right-hand 
side of the screen that "wraps around" to hit tiles on the left-hand side of
the screen. To do this, you want to position yourself just at the edge of 
the first incline going up, then face to the right. Use this video here as
a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Zmx8eLdkc. Once at the right
position, you jump, aim down, and fire your shot just before you land so
that it clips through the ground below you. If done right, you'll hear the
sound of a door opening. Once that's done, short charge a Shinespark going
right to left, store it at the edge of the platform, then drop down and
Shinespark horizontally to the left to crash through the blocks and go into
the door that your Wraparound Shot opened to go all the way through the apt-
ly named Gauntlet. You'll impact on another door, so now go back a little 
bit to the right and short charge another Shinespark, storing it after you
transition into the next room and right before reaching the platform with
the Chozo statue. Drop a Power Bomb quickly, grab the [ENERGY TANK (05/14) -
39%], then roll down, left and climb up before your three seconds expires
to Shinespark across the rest of this area to get through it quickly. This
will take you to the very top of the zig-zag shaft that the Space Pirates 
are in, and there is a very specific trick to get the next two items.

Start by shooting out the top two layers of blocks ahead of you, then put
yourself dead center in the middle block. Either jump and shoot down or set
a Power Bomb to destroy the last layer, and if your position is correct you
will fall through the two columns of crumble blocks simultaneously. If you
have perfected this trick, you can speed it along by Quick Dropping, but
halfway down you need to straighten out and fire to the left to break the
wall, then spin jump out of your fall animation to reach the [MISSILE TANK
(085/230) - 40%]. Once back on solid ground, shoot the right-hand wall and
spin jump across to collect the second [MISSILE TANK (090/230) - 41%]. If
you fail this trick it is a very lengthy return trip, so practice this until
you get it right. Once both Missile Tanks are in hand, continue dropping 
down past the Pirates, and continue along your way down through the mushroom
room to reach the elevator down to the jungle area of Brinstar.

### Brinstar

Once you reach Brinstar, drop down past the ledges to reach the very bottom
of the area. Use a Power Bomb to destroy part of the floor, then fall down
another long tunnel and take the green door on the left. You'll enter a room

filled with Beetoms, but you can ignore them and head through the next door 
into a metallic room. This has a false floor, so be careful. Run to the left

and spin jump just as the you see the [ENERGY TANK (06/14) - 42%] to clear 
the gap and collect it, then enter the next green door to grab another [SUP-
ER MISSILE Tank (20/50) - 43%], then exit the room and fall through the hole
in the floor. Roll through the narrow passage to reach a room filled with 
Zebs, Beetoms, and spikes. Damage boost off the spikes to get to the other
side, where you'll find the friendly trio of Etecoons. You're already a pro-
fessional speedrunner, so ignore their lesson about wall jumping and single
wall jump all the way up the right-hand wall to reach a Morph Ball tunnel
leading to a [POWER BOMB TANK (20/50) - 44%]. To get out, do a quick short
hop Mockball and use your speed to fly over the gap so you don't fall back
to the bottom, then take the next door to get back to the main vertical
area. Backtrack to the large pink room where you got the Charge Beam and
charge the Speed Booster as you race across. Store a Shinespark right at the
edge, drop down and set a Power Bomb (for later), then diagonally Shinespark
up-left to reach an upper platform with a [MISSILE TANK (095/230) - 45%] and
set a Power Bomb to clear out part of the wall. Drop down and go on through 
the hidden wall and head to the left, set a Power Bomb to kill the Sidehopp-
ers, then fire a Super Missile down at the odd-shaped block to find another 
[POWER BOMB TANK (25/50) - 46%]. If you're especially quick, you can spin 
jump back into the hole you dropped into, wall jumping back up. If not, you 
have to solve the puzzle with the moving pillars to exit the room. Either
way, get back to the large pink room and head across it to reach a door that
was opened with your earlier Power Bomb. Go inside and detonate another Pow-
er Bomb to kill the Sidehoppers, then spin and single wall jump up the cent-
ral pillar in the room. Shoot the blue gate and mid-air morph to get under
it, then fall down the other side to reach a door to another [ENERGY TANK 
(07/14) - 47%]. Exit back to the large pink room and go down two levels as
you set another mid-air Power Bomb to an area where there is a Reo and some 
vegetation on the ground. The Power Bomb should have cleared out part of the
wall, so now find an area on the ground where there are two vine-like pieces
sticking up from the floor. Position Samus' left foot just on top of the
smaller of the two, then jump straight up and fire a Super Missile while you
move right. This should cause your Super Missile to scroll over a bit and 
strike the Super Missile block just offscreen, so now roll into the tunnel
and enter the next room. Damage boost off of the first of the three sets of
Zebs and continue into the next room to pick up the [SUPER MISSILE TANK (25/
50) - 48%] that should've been the first one after Spore Spawn.

Now exit back to the large pink area and return to the bottom towards where
the path to the Charge Beam was. Grab the [MISSILE TANK (100/230) - 49%] 
here, then Bomb down into the room the Charge Beam was in, setting a Power
Bomb as you fall to blow up a tunnel underneath the Chozo statue. Follow
this path down to a red door, then Speed Boost through the rocks to reach
another [ENERGY TANK (08/14) - 50%]. Climb back out of here and continue
along the path to the green jungle area just to the right, and halfway down
your descent, spin jump into an upper pipe and roll to another [MISSILE TANK
(105/230) - 51%]. We're now halfway to our item percentage goal, so keep 
going by dropping down and continuing along the path, past Noob Bridge into
Red Tower. Fall all the way to the bottom and head to the right, using the 
same steps you did before to cross these rooms until you get to the large 
glass tube. Shatter it with a Power Bomb while pressing Left or Right to 
make it explode faster, then climb up to reach Maridia.

### Maridia

Once you get through the door in the ceiling, to your right will be a red
door and to the left is a Skultera. Kill the Skultera, then use this flat
area to short charge the Speed Booster, then Shinespark vertically right as
you stand in front of a waving plant on the ground. This will carry you up
right into a [MISSILE TANK (110/230) - 52%]. As you drop, hold Right to land
on or near a ledge and continue down until you reach a ledge with a door; 
take this into the next area and wall jump up to the next valley, then go 
down past the Space Pirates that can't be killed just yet. Continue running
to the right through a hidden wall to reach another door. Go through and 
charge the Speed Booster, then spin jump out into the center, straighten out
and vertically Shinespark to fly up to the ceiling. Hold Right as you fall 
to land on a Grapple Block holding another [ENERGY TANK (09/14) - 53%], then

make a long spin jump out to the right, then press up to break the spin and
shoot diagonally down to reveal and grab a [MISSILE Tank (115/230) - 54%] as
you fall. Fall to the bottom and go back past the Tatori and Kame Babies to
the large valley room with the Space Pirates and take the door in the upper
left ceiling. Here, single wall jump up the left wall and mid-air morph into
a hidden tunnel that leads to a [SUPER MISSILE TANK (30/50) - 55%], then
return to the large room you came from, affectionately named Mt. Everest due
to its size. Along the bottom here, run to the right and charge the Speed
Booster, then diagonally Shinespark up to the right to reach the door that
leads out.

This next room has two paths. Take the upper path first to a blue door in
the ceiling which leads to a sandy area. Head to the right and go through a 
hidden wall to reach a [MISSILE TANK (120/230) - 56%], then go out and take 
the upper path. Go up and head to the left to reach another door, and just
tank the damage from the Menus while avoiding the Owtchs on the floor. Run
through another false wall and spin jump up to a door at the upper left,
then continue on into the next open room. Head left past the pits and fall
down the long one at the left, shooting straight down the middle to land in
a room with a [MISSILE TANK (125/230) - 57%] and a [SUPER MISSILE TANK (35/
50) - 58%] in a double pack. Two for the price of one, and it's not the only
time this happens in Super Metroid. Now backtrack through this area to reach
the room with the initial path split and take the bottom path down past all
of the Scisers and head to the right to reach another large open room. Set a
Power Bomb to get to the lower area of this room, then go to the right and
use single wall jumps to climb up the left-hand wall to reach a door in the
ceiling, which takes you to a room filled with Mochtroids. Shoot out the
walls to clear a path, then use the Speed Booster to break through the re-
maining ones to reach the end of the room. Select the Power Bombs and turn 
off Ice (if you still have it equipped) and Spazer, then enter the next door
to reach the next mini-boss fight.

#### Mini-Boss Battle: Botwoon

HIT POINTS: 3000
ATTACKS:    Collision (32 dmg), Poison Dart (24 dmg)

Botwoon is a sea serpent that swims in out of holes in the background wall
of this room. Its only vulnerable spot is its head, so start this fight 
off by charging up an X-Factor and let it loose while standing right of 
the room's center, above the break in the pipe geometry, then move to the
center. The X-Factor should hit Botwoon just as it emerges from the first
hole, then as it travels across the room, pound it with Super Missiles to
rapidly deplete its health. It should take seven total to inflict the 
remaining 2000 damage needed to kill it. Botwoon's speed ordinarily will
increase at 1200 and 600 HP respectively, but using the X-Factor and the
rapid Missile assault seems to delay or prevent this.

With Botwoon out of the way, you can proceed into the next area, a long room

filled with quicksand and Puyos. There's an Energy Tank in the ceiling, but
it'll be skipped for now. Speed Boost past the Puyos and across the quick-
sand, opening the next door and quickly storing a Shinespark as you enter
the next vertical room. You have less than three seconds now to single wall
jump up the right-hand wall and open the next door to reach the large open
Colosseum. Get up here fast, enter the room and take a small spin jump out
to clear the overhang, then break the spin and Shinespark horizontally to
clear the entire room in a Full Halfie trick. Doing this saves you needing
the Grappling Beam or otherwise complicated wall jumping. Once on the other
side, drop down and take the bottom door, then spin jump across the false
floor and head across the room to shoot the wall, revealing a [MISSILE TANK
(130/230) - 59%]. Now backtrack to the false floor, fall down to reach the
Gadora, kill it with a Super Missile, and head inside to initiate the battle
against Draygon.

#### Boss Battle: Draygon

HIT POINTS: 6000
ATTACKS:    Collision (40 dmg), Tail Whip (43 dmg), Turret (32 dmg), Power
Node (4 dmg/second), Gray Mucus (N/A; causes slowdown)

Draygon is going to be another boss to be killed with some fancy trickery.
While the pre-boss animation plays, use Missiles to eliminate the turrets
in the room so that they aren't firing at you, then head down and wait by
the right-hand door for the Evirs to finish their little romantic Kanji 
dance. Once they've scrolled offscreen, prepare an X-Factor, then drop to
the bottom and, going from left to right, short charge the Speed Booster.
Just as Draygon enters the screen, you'll want to hit with the X-Factor 
and simultaneously jump up, horizontally Shinesparking just above Dray-
gon's belly. Drop down, run left to right again while short charging and
Draygon should enter slowly from the right. Hit her belly with Missiles or
Super Missiles, then before you get grabbed, jump and initiate another
horizontal Shinespark for the kill. Doing this will trigger a Bluesuit,
which you'll convert into a Sparksuit shortly.

Draygon has an insidiously long death animation, so while this is happening,
run (don't hold the Run button!) to the right-hand side and use the two sets
of sparking turrets to convert your Bluesuit into a Sparksuit by morphing,
then unmorphing on the frame you take damage and Shinesparking about 9 to 10
frames later. If done correctly, Samus will Shinespark vertically but won't
actually go anywhere. With the Sparksuit active, you'll be able to hold the
Run button again, so head into the left-hand door to find a Chozo statue 
with the [SPACE JUMP - 60%], then use the new item to get out of Draygon's 
room and back to Colosseum. Climb to the top and press Down to trigger your 
stored Shinespark, then use it to Reverse Halfie back across the room. Back 
in the vertical room with Mochtroids, drop to the bottom and head back into
the room with all the quicksand. Space Jump up at the very end to tuck into
a tunnel leading to an [ENERGY TANK (10/14) - 61%], then drop down and use
Quick Drops to fall instantly through the quicksand. Damage boost off of the
Bulls as you fall, then in the next room head left through the door while
charging up the Speed Booster. Store a Shinespark and use it diagonally-left
just before you would touch the false floor in the middle so you can rocket 
up to another level to find a [MISSILE TANK (135/230) - 62%], then head to 
the right and and spin jump over the crumble blocks to pick up the [SUPER 
MISSILE TANK (40/50) - 63%]. Now drop down to the bottom and run to the 
right, shooting your way through the floor to reach a section below. Run to 
the left and drop into the first quicksand pit by Quick Dropping at the 
right-hand side.

This drops you through another room with Bulls, so continue the quick drop
technique to reach the bottom, then aim down so you don't bounce when you
hit the quicksand pit below you. Space Jump up the left-hand side to grab
another [MISSILE TANK (140/230) - 64%], then go down and to the right. Space
Jump up and mid-air morph at the tunnel to tuck yourself inside so you can
grab the next [POWER BOMB TANK (30/50) - 65%], then drop down and head to
the right, quick dropping again through the next quicksand pit. This will
place you in a long horizontal room with some Evirs; ignore them and Space
Jump to reach a door on the right which leads to a room with a lone grapple
block. Ignore it and head into the next room, where you need to shoot up
through the ceiling. Reactivate Ice Beam if you haven't already, then climb
up and freeze the top-right Puyo as it starts to bounce and spin jump on top
of it to kago yourself through the platform to reach the next door. In here
is a long tunnel with a Shaktool; immediately set a Power Bomb to blow up
the metal pillar, then patiently wait for the Shaktool to carve its way
through the sand. Once its done, head into the next door to reach a Morph 
Ball maze that you can simply drop down into and head to the right to find a
Chozo statue that holds the [SPRING BALL - 66%] upgrade. Since you can use
this to bounce in Morph Ball form, use it to get out of this area and back-
track to the room with the Evirs. Space Jump through it and detonate a Power
Bomb in the next room to reach a path leading up to the large Maridia Pipe -

a metallic shaft that connects the northern sector to the main area of this 
region. You'll wind up in another sandy area. Go up and over all of the nat-
ural obstructions to reach an underhang beneath you. Try to jump off and 
engage the Space Jump so you can (a) continue to Space Jump to the door, or
(b) keep spinning against the wall and then use wall jumps to reach it. If 
these methods don't work, fall to the bottom and just Space Jump your way
back here. Open the now-flashing door to find a vertical room with Puyos and

other enemies, and use the Space Jump or wall jumps to reach the top, where 
a door leads through a short hallway into a room with six Space Pirates. 
Ignore them and drop to the bottom-right corner, where a Chozo statue holds 
the last of your beam upgrades, the [PLASMA BEAM - 67%]. Now you can destroy
these pink Space Pirates, so kill all of them and return back the way you
came all the way to the bottom of the sandy area, then take the blue door at
the right.

Space Jump across the quicksand here and use the flashing door to reach a
room with some Cacatacs. Space Jump up to the door at the upper right to
reach Cacatac Alley, then Space Jump through the room to reach the door at
the other side. This puts you back in the vertical Mochtroid room before the
Colosseum, so drop down and head left, following the same path you did the
first time to get to the bottom-most path with the two quicksand pits. This
time, take the second quicksand pit and quick drop through on the right. 
Quick drop again through a room with Bulls to reach another large room with
two items to grab. Space Jump up through the path just off-center, then 
morph and inch forward until you trigger the crumble blocks. Now without 
falling, Spring Ball up and around to the right, then Spring Ball up again 
to reach the [MISSILE TANK (145/230) - 68%] and roll to the right through 
the next passage to claim the [RESERVE TANK (3/4) - 69%]. With both items in
hand, drop down and sink through the quicksand on the left-hand side to get
to a second hallway with Evirs in it. Space Jump to the door at the left 
this time and you'll reach a room with a smashed pipe and Scisers. Drop down
through the bottom of the room to find a secret exit with a green gate that 
returns you back to Brinstar just before the shattered glass tube.

### Brinstar

Head to the right to reach the elevator to Norfair. Before heading down,
continue to the right through the Super Missile blocks to get the last item
from Kraid's Lair.

### Kraid's Lair

Return through all of the rooms here to reach the area with the Kihunters.
Take them out and head to the right-hand wall and set off a Power Bomb to
expose both a path and a [MISSILE TANK (150/230) - 70%]. Spring Ball up into

the Morph Ball Tunnel, grab the Tank, then exit back out of Kraid's Lair.

### Brinstar

Take the elevator down to Norfair.

### Norfair

Drop into the main corridor and take the first door on the left, as if you
were heading towards where you got the Ice Beam. Use the Speed Booster to 
get past the gates to expose a path in the floor leading down. Set a Power 
Bomb to get rid of some more blocks, then drop into a large room filled with
Violas and FireFleas. Head left to reach a blue door, running at full speed
and firing a shot just on the other side to break the wall, then Space Jump
to reach the [MISSILE TANK (155/230) - 71%] before falling all the way down
and taking the door on the right. Speed Boost down the incline, through the
rocks and bypass the green door, heading instead through the blue door on
the right. Continue speed Space Jumping through this room, take the blue 
door on the right and Space Jump over the energy refill. Continue going to
the right and Space Jump through this large room with Yapping Maws and the
Grapple Block ceiling to reach another door leading to a blue gate. Shoot it
with the Wave Beam and roll through the hidden tunnel to drop into a vert-
ical area with Violas circling the platforms. Drop to the bottom, set a Pow-
er Bomb to open the yellow door, and then damage boost off of the lowest of
the Violas to sail through the door and down into the large pit of lava.
Once you stop, turn and Space Jump up past the Namihes to reach the ledge at
the top, then take the door to reach the elevator to Ridley's Lair.

### Ridley's Lair

Ridley's Lair is considerably more dangerous than the upper regions, and the
enemies here are some of the toughest you'll find on the planet. From the
start, head slightly to the right, then turn and short charge the Speed
Booster so you can speed jump all the way to the door on the left without
being struck by any of the enemies or vents. Space Jump across the lava pit,
then mid-air morph and set a Power Bomb to destroy a wall, which reveals a
standing Chozo statue. Morph into its palm to cause the lava to recede, then
drop down into the hole in the floor, setting more Power Bombs to clear the
rubble from your path. In the next area, ignore the Holtz and Magdollites to
get to the next door. The next room has crumble blocks on the floor, but you
can cross it by morphing and using the Spring Ball to bounce over while 
still holding Jump to bounce off so you can grab the [MISSILE TANK (160/230)
 - 72%] without falling. Once you've grabbed it, fall down and head to the
right to trigger another Torizo statue to fall from the ceiling. This leads 
to another mini-boss fight, but first, Space Jump up, mid-air morph and set
a Power Bomb to clear some rubble, then Space Jump up again and grab the 
[SUPER MISSILE TANK (45/50) - 73%] from its hidden location. Now fall down 
and fight the mini-boss.

#### Mini-Boss Battle: Golden Torizo

HIT POINTS: 13500
ATTACKS:    Collision (40 dmg), Wave Attack (30 dmg), Eye Laser (2 dmg),
Bomb Spread (20 dmg), Mini-Torizo (20 dmg), Super Missile (50
dmg)

This Torizo is heavily armored and is quite a bit tougher than the last
version you fought in Crateria. While well-timed Super Missiles can deal
heavy damage, the Golden Torizo is capable of catching them and hurling 
them right back at you, so forget using these and stick to charged beams 
instead. For the most part, the Golden Torizo's attack pattern is the same
as the Silver Torizo's, though this one will add a laser beam attack and
is capable of summoning a horde of miniature Torizos that fly at you for 
20 HP of damage apiece. Just stay in front of it and alternate jumping up
and down while firing charged beams at it from above and below to keep it
in place. 15 shots should take it down.

Your reward for defeating the Gold Torizo is the [SCREW ATTACK - 74%], which
coupled with the Space Jump makes you nigh invulnerable. The next area is a 
long vertical section, so Screw Attack through the ceiling and Space Jump to
the door at the top. This takes you to a long room with Ripper IIs zipping 
back and forth. These move extremely fast, but you can eliminate them with 
the Screw Attack. Head to the end and open the green gate, then continue 
on to reach the aptly-named "worst room in the game" for Any% reasons. This
room is filled with Namihes and gold Space Pirates that can only be killed
with the Screw Attack (and since you don't have that in Any%.... yeah, it's
the WRITG). Climb up this entire room to reach the top, then shoot through 
the ceiling to expose a new path, then climb up and take the door. In this 
new room, drop to the far left and set a Bomb to reach a Morph Ball tunnel
that leads to the left into a heart-shaped (Mickey Mouse-shaped?) room with 
a [MISSILE TANK (165/230) - 75%]. Exit this room and Spring Ball back to the
ledge above you, then return to the room you came from and go to the door 
next to the last gold Space Pirate. Space Jump through this door into the 
spacious Amphitheatre, which fills up quickly with lava. You should Space
Jump across and basically cling to the large stalactite, following the path
down, across, and up to reach the door at the top right.     

The next room features a short hallway with a door at the end, but that path
will be taken later. For now, shoot through the floor to reach a series of
zig-zagging ledges with Red Kihunters. Screw Attack them on the way down,
and set a Power Bomb at the bottom to reveal tunnels beneath you, and keep
following the path to the right. In the next area, set another Power Bomb to
open the yellow door, then set another one immediately while you drop to the
left to raise a pole in case you don't make it into the tunnel by falling.
Travel left and Bomb through the wall to reach a room filled with Dessgeegas
and destroy them while continuing to the left. Destroy the path leading down
and the left-hand wall with another Power Bomb, then head through the wall
to the left to grab the [POWER BOMB TANK (35/50) - 76%]. Now go back and
drop into the hole in the floor, using the spikes to kago past the platforms
to reach the green door at the bottom. In this room are two Space Pirates
that you have to bait into turning gold. Scroll them off the screen, then 
run back so that one uses a flying kick attack and pound them with about two
or three Super Missiles when they land and turn gold. Once they're gone, use
the flashing door to reach another long room filled with Zebbos, Holtzes, 
and Gerutas. Ignore all of them by Speed Boosting through the lava at the
bottom, then make a running Screw Attack across the next room to reach the
Gadora at the end. Destroy it and head inside to fight Ridley.

#### Boss Battle: Ridley

HIT POINTS: 18000
ATTACKS:    Collision (40 dmg), Fireballs (15 dmg apiece), Tail Whip (30
dmg), Lava (steady dmg)

Ridley starts off the battle invisible, so you can drop a Power Bomb here
to start off the fight with some free damage, then make sure you have the
Ice Beam equipped. For the most part, you can just stay on the center 
platform, jump up, and fire your charged shots - Ridley rarely stays at 
the top for too long and this gives you great vantage points to hit him.
Once below 14,500 HP Ridley will incorporate swooping attacks, and this is
where you can trap him in a pogo animation. Wait until Ridley is facing
left, then position yourself so your left foot is off the platform. Ridley
will attempt to stab downward at you, but he can't hit you in this area,
which gives you many free chances to score damage. Ridley's speed will in-
crease at 9,000 HP and again at 4,500 HP, but just keep landing charged
shots and Super Missiles if you can get them to connect since they do 600
damage to him. Towards the very end of the fight, Ridley can enter an en-
raged state where he hurls fireballs and tries to grab you. Keep firing
and let him grab you so that the enraged state ends, and he will die. It
will take 20 fully charged shots to defeat him.

Once Ridley is dead, enter the room to the left to find the remains of the
Baby Metroid's capsule, and bomb the right-hand wall to find an [ENERGY TANK
(11/14) - 77%], then start backtracking out of Ridley's Lair all the way up
to the vertical area with the Red Kihunters. Once at the top, take the door
to the left to find a stone statue of Ridley. Destroy the Fune on the wall
with a Super Missile and race through the wall to find an area leading down
that is surrounded by Firefleas. Try to avoid killing them since it removes
your light source and Space Jump to the [ENERGY TANK (12/14) - 78%] hidden
at the lower-left corner. Go back up now and ascend the inclined ledges as
you avoid the remaining Funes and rocks, then at the top head to the left
to reach a false wall that leads to a door. Follow this path to the left,
then go up and head to the right for a [MISSILE TANK (170/230) - 79%] and 
set a Power Bomb along the wall to reveal a network of Morph Ball tunnels.
Spring Ball into the maze, then keep using the Spring Ball to stay along the
top until you reach the exit. Take this into the next room and go down into
a room with barricades in the middle that you can destroy with a Power Bomb.
Jump onto the crumbling pillar on the right to get the [POWER BOMB TANK (40/
50) - 80%], then collapse the other pillar and head back to the left. This
takes you back across at the top of the room with the Funes, so cross back
through the false wall, climb to the top of the next room and continue to
the left to reach a new area with rising and falling lava tides. Wait until 
the tide has receded, then Bomb part of the raised platform to drop into a 
hidden passage that leads to another [MISSILE TANK (175/230) - 81%]. Now go
back out and keep going up, using the Screw Attack to take out the Kihunters
as you go. At the very top, go to the left to find a hidden passage that 
returns you to the vertical room adjacent to Bubble Mountain.

### Norfair

Enter the green bubble room and use the Space Jump to go past the Cacatac 
and the Waver to reach a green door near the ceiling. Open it and go inside
to find another [MISSILE TANK (180/230) - 82%] on a pedestal, then set a 
Power Bomb to raise a metallic pole. Ride the pole to a hidden passage that
leads to another room, where you can Space Jump to the end to find an orb 
holding the final [RESERVE TANK (4/4) - 83%] on the ledge. After collecting
it, shoot diagonally-right at the last platform to expose another [MISSILE
TANK (185/230) - 84%], then go back to the right to return to Bubble Mount-
ain. This time fall all the way down and head to the far right, shooting 
down through the floor to reach an area with a Waver and another [MISSILE
TANK (190/230) - 85%], then climb up, head left to the door and set a Power
Bomb to break the floor which takes you back down to the area with the two
doors. Enter the left hand door again, but take the bottom path this time
and shoot the blue gate to reach another path leading down. Drop all the way
to the bottom past the Geemers and Pirates to reach a door in the floor. Go
through it, then head all the way left past the Dragons to reach the next
door, which takes you to the end of Crocomire Speedway. Fire a Super Missile
at the green door to drop down to the next mini-boss fight.

#### Mini-Boss Battle: Crocomire

HIT POINTS: N/A
ATTACKS:    Collision (20 dmg), Claw (20 dmg), Fireball (10 dmg)

Oh, you thought I was being serious? No, we aren't going to fight Croco-
mire, as cute and harmless as he is. Wait for his first attack, then fire
a charged shot at his mouth and take a running jump with a mid-air morph
at the peak to roll over his head and get behind him.

Skipping Crocomire means the next part needs to be done quickly. Speed Boost
along to the right, then make a speeding Space Jump across the lava to reach
the [ENERGY TANK (13/14) - 86%], then get back to the other side where Croc-
omire should just be backing up backwards into the lava. Let his death anim-
ation play out, then Speed Boost to the left to the spiked wall and store a
Shinespark. Use the time that Crocomire is traveling along the bottom to 
jump into the spikes and convert your Shinespark into a Spikesuit, then let
the rest of the animation play out. Once you can proceed, head left and use
Space Jumps to cross the gap to land by a red door that leads to another
[POWER BOMB TANK (45/50) - 87%], then exit and drop down, going through the
door in the floor. Fall down the length of this vertical shaft and head 
through the next door at the bottom. This will drop you in a room filled 
with rocky obstructions, so set a Power Bomb to clear the debris, then go to
the right, and run left to charge the Speed Booster. Blast through the rocks
and use the ramp to make a long spinning Speed Booster jump across the gap
to land by the blue door. Head inside to get to the Chozo statue holding the
[GRAPPLING BEAM - 88%], then return the way you came and make a running
Space Jump through the room, up to the top past the Rippers to claim another
[MISSILE TANK (195/230) - 89%], then drop back down and take the path under
the wall back to the door in the ceiling. 

Now climb up and take the red door to the right, then as the lava rises and 
falls in the next room, short charge the Speed Booster and store a Shine-
spark. Roll under the tunnel and horizontally Shinespark across the rest of 
the room to reach a [MISSILE TANK (200/230) - 90%], then go back the way you
came, charging the Speed Booster again as you approach the door. Go through 
and vertically Shinespark all the way to the top, then take the door in the 
ceiling. Now backtrack through Crocomire's room and through the door in the 
ceiling, and keep going up past the two Cacatacs to reach a blue door at the
top. In here, take the bottom path through the rocks and Space Jump up to 
the upper left corner where you can grab another [MISSILE TANK (205/230) - 
91%] and shoot the green gate with a Super Missile. This path takes you back
to the main vertical corridor of Norfair, so climb all the way to the top 
and take the elevator back to Brinstar.

### Brinstar

Go left through all of the doors, Space Jumping across all of the rooms to
get back to Red Tower. Single wall jump up the right-hand side and Space
Jump the rest of the way up, then set a Power Bomb to both kill a Beetom and
destroy a wall blocking a Power Bomb door. Go through the door and now use
your still-stored Shinespark to fly horizontally across the entirety of the
room to reach the red door at the end. If you move just fast enough you can
leap to the upper left corner and mid-air morph into the tunnel to get past
this area faster; otherwise solve the intended Bomb and pole puzzle to get
to the Chozo statue holding your final upgrade, the [X-RAY SCOPE - 92%]. Now
exit the room by shooting the wall behind the statue to reveal a hidden path
and take it down through the floor and up into the maze. Exit the room and
make a running Space Jump to continue back across the room, then once you
get to Red Tower, climb up to the middle and take the left-hand path back
into the jungle area.

Speed Boost back across Noob Bridge to the previous room. Shoot the blue
gate to access the rest of the room, then Space Jump up through the room to
reach the top. Instead of going through the door, Space Jump up to the right
to reach the Power Bomb door and blast it to access a new area of the blue
part of Brinstar along with a little family of Sidehoppers. Destroy all of
them and use a Power Bomb to blast through the wall to reveal a path to the
final [POWER BOMB TANK (50/50) - 93%] of the game, then continue to the
right with Power Bombs to get back to the area where you got the Morphing
Ball at the start. Head back through here and take the door at the end, then
go through the red door on the other side of this room. This room should be
familiar if you've played the NES Metroid as its pretty much the same. Kill
the Skrees and Geemers here, then shoot the ceiling near the right-hand wall
to reveal the final [ENERGY TANK (14/14) - 94%], then roll underneath the
wall and set a Power Bomb as you go to the right to collect another [MISSILE
TANK (210/230) - 95%], then Screw Attack/Space Jump up the narrow vertical
corridor to reach the top. Head left and Space Jump up to reach an invisible
bridge, then run across to reach the Billy Mays room where you can grab the
[MISSILE TANK (215/230) - 96%] and... but wait, there's more! Shoot the left
edge of the platform to reveal another [MISSILE TANK (220/230) - 97%]. Now
go back the way you came, down through the long tunnel and head left to get
back to the elevator from Brinstar to the old Tourian area in Crateria.

### Crateria

Emerging back here, head left and take out the Space Pirates. Morph and set
a Power Bomb on top of Mother Brain's old chamber to reveal a path leading
down to another hidden [MISSILE TANK (225/230) - 98%], then climb back up
and head left into the Craterian shaft. Space Jump up to the one ledge that
sticks out from the wall on the right and Bomb through the wall to reach a
Power Bomb door. Destroy it, then head inside while Speed Boosting and fir-
ing diagonally down-right to freeze the Boyons. Store a Shinespark at the
end and rocket diagonally up-right to hit the final [SUPER MISSILE TANK (50/
50) - 99%] of the game during your ascent. Head to the left, Space Jump your
way across the spikes, then head left and Bomb through the wall to get back
to the shaft, and take the door in the ceiling back into the cave area of 
Crateria. Go up one level and morph into the tunnel, setting a Power Bomb
along the way to clear out all of the blocks, which takes you to a blue door
leading to the final [MISSILE TANK (230/230) - 100%] of the game. Now that
you have collected all of the items, it's time to tackle Tourian. Climb up
the rest of this shaft and go to the left, through the wall, down through
the Terminator into the zig-zag shaft with the Space Pirates. Get to the
bottom and take the red door on the left through the long hallway to reach
the G4 statue, where you can take a break and wait while the statue crumbles
into the ground. After it's over, take the elevator down into Tourian.

### Tourian

Just a word of warning: if you plan on saving, do so at the first save stat-
ion in Tourian, because the next one after that is located past a point of
no return. Anyway Tourian is a short area that alternates between horizontal

and vertical areas, and the first few rooms are full of Metroids, so make
sure you have the Ice Beam equipped. Drop to the bottom and use the door on 
the right if you wish to save, otherwise use the door to the left to reach
the first Metroid room. The best way for handling Metroids is to speed your
way through the rooms to get all of them to chase you, then freezing them
all as a group and destroying them that way. They take 5 Missiles to kill or
a single Super Missile. There are four Metroids in this room, so kill all of
them and move onto the next room where you'll find two more as you make your
way to the bottom. Once they're dead, go into the third horizontal room that
has another three Metroids and take each of these out as you progress across
the room. At the end is a door that leads to the fourth room, where you'll
find another three as you zig zag down a few levels. Once all of the Metroid
creatures have been killed, you can head down into a sandy area. From here,
you can no longer go back.

Head to the left, damage boosting off of the two Sidehoppers here to reach
the next blue door. In the next room is a deceased Torizo and the room after
this has Rippers that look the same. As you progress, another Sidehopper 
will enter the screen before getting annihilated by the now-not-a Baby Met-
roid. The next part is a sequence that is supposed to drain your energy down
to a single unit, but you can manipulate the Baby Metroid's swoops by doing
a series of clockwise Space Jumps around it. This trick is called Baby Skip
and is detailed more in Section 7: Speedrunning Tricks. Practice this since
it is a major time save. Once you get past the Baby Metroid, drop down and
take the door on the right, Space Jump through the next room to reach the
last Gadora, then go through that door and drop down to the door at the
bottom left. Immediately upon entering the Zebetite Room, get to the first
one and perform the Zebetite Skip to keep the others from loading, and make
your way across the platforms to where the reborn Mother Brain is.

#### Boss Battle: Mother Brain, 1st Phase

HIT POINTS: 3000
ATTACKS:    Collision (15 dmg), Laser (20 dmg), Rinka (10 dmg)

Mother Brain is currently housed in a glass support structure just like in
the first game. It takes six Missiles to shatter her tube. Once you break
the glass, make a short hop Screw Attack towards the hole to get "stuck"
in it, and simply pound away at the exposed brain with Super Missiles. 
This quick method should avoid you needing to worry about the turrets or
Rinkas. Once the glass completely shatters, kneel at the edge of the plat-
form and continue to dump Super Missiles into her by aiming up until this 
form is destroyed.

Mother Brain's second phase begins when she connects to her mobile battle-
suit. This is mostly a scripted fight with a particular outcome, but there 
will be a little bit of manipulation here to achieve a consistent and fast
end to the fight.

#### Boss Battle: Mother Brain, 2nd Phase

HIT POINTS: 18000
ATTACKS:    Collision (30 dmg), Bomb - Contact (40 dmg), Bomb - Explosion
(20 dmg), Blue Ring (20 dmg per ring), Eye Laser (30 dmg), 
Flamestrike Beam (200 dmg), Hyper Brain Wave (300 dmg)
* All of Mother Brain's attacks do double damage if you remove the Varia
Suit. Gravity Suit has no bearing on damage variance here.

It is important that during this part of the fight you control your health
reserves. At the conclusion of this round, you need at least seven Energy
Tanks to survive the Hyper Beam attack and properly manipulate the Mother
Brain for the third round. During the fight, she moves back and forth,
using her basic attacks and increasing in intensity as her HP is whittled
down. She begins with the Bombing attack that spreads fire across the
ground and can also fire blue energy rings. Keep jumping straight up to
avoid these while you empty whatever Super Missiles you have left along
with charged Beams. Don't use Missiles; they are too ineffective for dam-
age. After a certain HP threshold is reached, Mother Brain will start to
use a powerful fire beam attack that travels diagonally, so you can just
jump over it. This is the part where you want to start manipulating your
health. Either run into Mother Brain and take consistent damage until you
are just over 7 Energy Tanks or remove the Varia Suit for a little extra
damage. Keep firing at her head in the meantime, but by the time Mother
Brain does a second screech and rears back, you want to be at approximate-
ly 700 HP. If you took Varia off, put it back on immediately. Her next
attack is the devastating Hyper Beam, which will drain 300 HP as well as
your ammunition reserves (600 if you did it without Varia). After you get
struck, you want to have a hair over 400 HP so that you can run into the
legs to damage yourself down to about 350. At this point, the game will
check to see if you can survive a second Hyper Beam attack, and you want
that answer to be "yes".

The Hyper Beam does 300 damage to you, which is why you need to deplete your
reserves a bit. If you have under 300 HP, the game forces you into a kneel-
ing position and the cutscene takes over. Having over 400 means the game
thinks you can withstand another hit, so you can still move. Depleting your-
self under 400 will cause the Baby Metroid to attack Mother Brain, and this
is what you want to happen. After damaging yourself a bit, the game tries
to force you to kneel. Counter this by spamming the Up button as fast as you
can, or use X-Ray Scope to force a standing position. Either way once you
are up, jump into the air and stay airborne for the entirety of the next
sequence. The Baby Metroid will fly onto the screen, attack Mother Brain and
drain her energy. After this is over, the Baby Metroid swoops over to donate
that energy to you. The Baby is such a good kid. You need to be airborne for
this part too; if you're on the ground when the Baby grabs you, you'll be
forced to kneel. You are safe to move once the Baby starts refilling your
Energy Tanks.

#### Boss Battle: Mother Brain, 3rd Phase

HIT POINTS: 36000
ATTACKS:    Collision (30 dmg), Bomb - Contact (40 dmg), Bomb - Explosion
(20 dmg), Blue Ring (20 dmg per ring), Eye Laser (30 dmg)

The moment the Baby starts refilling is when Mother Brain is given her HP
for the third phase. Now that you've executed the Standup Glitch and can
move around, start pumping charged Beams into Mother Brain's head to cause
damage even if it doesn't look like it. It takes 40 charged shots total to
kill this phase, and you should easily be able to get 30 or more in before
the Baby Metroid makes its sacrifice play. No matter what is happening on
the screen, continue firing charged shots at Mother Brain's head, even 
during and after she kills the Baby Metroid. Once you get the Hyper Beam, 
you can finish her off with a few shots and never have to worry about 
Mother Brain using any of her attacks.

After she's been defeated, she'll shrivel up and disintegrate, but this also
triggers the planetary time bomb! This time it won't just be Tourian that
blows up, so you need to hightail it out of here fast. When the wall opens
and the countdown begins, run into the next area and use the Hyper Beam to
destroy the barriers in your path. Drop and enter the door in the floor,
then fall down the right-hand side of the tunnel, firing downward to destroy
the Space Pirates and open the door before you get there. Enter the next 
room and drop to the bottom path. Run along the floor and charge the Speed
Booster and hold the charge at the end to Shinespark up through the barrier
to reach the next door. The next area is a gigantic maze, similar to the 
Amphitheatre room in Ridley's lair. Screw Attack to the top, using the small
ledges, then fire the Hyper Beam to destroy as many Space Pirates as you
can. Once at the bottom, the room starts to fill with lava, so Space Jump up
the platforms to reach the top. Charge the Speed Booster as you go through
the next door to exit Tourian back into Crateria.

### Crateria

The exit from Tourian puts you back in the Old Tourian escape shaft. Keep
charging the Speed Booster, then store the Shinespark after you've crashed
through the walls. Right under the first platform on the left, aim up-right
and Shinespark to fly all the way to the top against the right wall. Once 
you get to the top, head through the door in the ceiling to get back to the
Parlor and climb the platforms using Ledge Grabs to make it faster. Once at
the top, head across to the left, skipping the path back to Bomb Torizo's
room (this is a speedrun, we don't have time to save the animals) and exit
out to the landing site. Continue Speed Boosting and make a long jump out of
the tunnel to land at your ship. Press Down on the pad to enter it and get
off the planet.

After leaving, Zebes' core goes critical and the planet explodes in a blind-
ing flash of light. Had you shown mercy and rescued the animals, you would
see a pixel fly off indicating they escaped too, but you didn't. Murderer.
Anyway, your final time (in IGT) is displayed - following this guide should 
net you about 50 minutes or so. The staff credits will then roll and since
you finished in under three hours, you'll get the good pre-Zero Suit ending
with Samus in her shorts and a sports bra. Your final item percentage will
then be displayed and the obligatory "See you next mission!" appears on the
screen. And that is it for the 100% route. Once you've mastered this and
want a new challenge, you can try the two Any% routes listed below. Once you
have mastered those... go find another guide to follow. I'm not writing Low
% or Reverse Boss Order stuff.

## 8B. Any% KPDR Route

The Any% route will not be as detailed as the 100% walkthrough, and will only
include very condensed paragraphs detailing the major movement objectives on
the route. Movement is more or less based on combinations of Behemoth's and
Zoast's KPDR movement, but since I'm writing this from a beginner's perspect-
ive, I have added in a few safety items. Boss strategies remain generally the 
same as in 100%, since unlike PRKD route you will still collect Plasma Beam. 
As with the 100% walkthrough, tricks will not be described and all ground-
based movement should incorporate Arm Pumping or the Zohdin variant. During 
this route you will be collecting only the following items: 5x Missile Tanks, 
4x Energy Tanks, 2x Super Missile Tanks, 1 Power Bomb Tank, the Morphing Ball,
Bombs, Charge Beam, Spazer, Varia Suit, Hi-Jump Boots, Speed Booster, Wave 
Beam, Ice Beam, Gravity Suit, Space Jump, and Plasma Beam for a grand total of

24%. The run begins when you touch down on Ceres.

Space Colony

From the start, Moonfall to the first door. Proceed through the remaining 
rooms and get Ridley to deplete your health down to 29 HP. Exit the Space 
Colony the same way you came in, using damage boosts to cross the large room
with falling tiles and use ledge grabs to quickly climb the first room back 
to the elevator.

Crateria

Once you arrive on Zebes and exit your ship, head left into the next room 
and go down the vertical shaft. In the Tourian shaft, Moonfall down the 
right-hand side and take the path at the bottom through the old Mother Brain
chamber to the elevator and take it down to Brinstar.

Brinstar

Head left to get the [MORPHING BALL], then head to the right and through the
floor to reach the first [MISSILE TANK (1/5)]. Collect it, then go back up, 
mid-air morphing through the left-hand path to return to the elevator. Go 
back up to Crateria.

Crateria

Kill the Space Pirates, then single wall jump up the Tourian Shaft. Return
to the first main room and drop into the tunnel, heading to the right to get
the [BOMBS] and fight Bomb Torizo. Kill it and exit via Alcatraz at the left
and bomb through the far left-hand wall. Head down the long tunnel for the 
first [ENERGY TANK (1/4)], then go past the Space Pirates and take the next 
diagonal path down to reach the elevator to Brinstar.

Brinstar

In Green Brinstar, take the right-hand path, killing enemies for Missile 
refills, then open the first red door on the right. Take a running spin jump
into the room and Mockball past the gates to climb up in the ceiling and get
the first [SUPER MISSILE TANK (1/2)], then drop back down and exit to the 
previous room. Fall and take the door at the bottom right, running through 
this whole room and bombing through the wall at the end. This takes you to a
large pink room; fall to the very bottom and set a Bomb by the block while 
collecting the [MISSILE TANK (2/5)], then roll into the hole in the floor to
get the [CHARGE BEAM]. Climb back out, go up and over the obstruction and 
use the green door. Head down through the room, Mockballing where necessary 
to pick up speed, and shoot through the gate. Collect Super Missile refills
from the Cacatacs in the next room and speed across the Noob Bridge to reach
the door leading to the red part of Brinstar.

In this long shaft, drop to the bottom and go through the right-hand door. 
Cross the room with damage boosts, and in the next room shoot through the 
ceiling and wall jump up to the path to get the [SPAZER]. Drop back down and
continue heading to the right until you reach the elevator room. Shoot a 
Super Missile at the wall and use a long wall jump to get up to the entrance
to Kraid’s Lair. 

Kraid's Lair

Enter and proceed through the network of rooms, wall jumping up when it's
necessary to reach a ceiling door, then shoot through the path in the floor 
to reach the gauntlet to Kraid. Kill the Space Pirates and Mini-Kraid, coll-
ecting refills, then head through the next room and damage boost off the 
spikes to reach the Gadora guarding the path to Kraid. Kill it and head in 
to fight Kraid, using the stunlock quick kill method. Once he's dead, go and
collect the [VARIA SUIT], then go back out the way you came, stopping by the
now-unlocked door to pick up a free [ENERGY TANK (2/4)]. Once you have it,
climb up to exit this area.

Brinstar

Exit the lair and use a Super Missile to get back across the gap, then take
the elevator down to Norfair.

Norfair

Drop all the way down to the third door on the left. Grab the [ENERGY TANK 
(3/4)] and kill the Sova before it goes offscreen to be able to open the 
unlocked door. Take the path down and enter the door to collect the [HI-JUMP
BOOTS], then exit and climb up to the path at the top. Grab the [MISSILE 
TANK (3/5)] on the way and go back to the main entry area. Climb up and take
the second door on the right, following the path until you reach the green 
Bubble Mountain area. Make a long wall jump off the second ledge to climb up
and over the Cacatac, then take the upper right door into a room with three 
Metarees. Kill them and climb up through the ceiling and through the next 
door, running all the way down the diagonal slopes to the next room to 
collect the [SPEED BOOSTER]. Take this path back out past the rising lava to
Bubble Mountain, then drop down and take the bottom path door. Follow this 
area and drop one level down to the next door, heading across the floating 
platforms to reach a ledge with another [MISSILE TANK (4/5)]. As the fanfare
ends, continue your dash off the ledge and spin jump across the room, wall 
jumping up the right-hand wall to reach another red door. Head in and grab 
the [WAVE BEAM], then exit this room and trek back across the large room 
back towards Bubble Mountain. Back in here, go down through the Morph Ball 
maze and take the door to the left. Speed Boost through the path to reach 
the first room you entered in and climb back up toward the elevator. Before 
leaving, enter the first door on the left and Mockball past the falling 
gates to reach the next room. Cross the floating platforms into the zig-
zagging room and jump up while mid-air morphing to quickly reach the passage
that leads to the [ICE BEAM]. Exit the way you came and again Mockball past 
the falling gates to return to the elevator room, then go back up to Brin-
star.

Brinstar

Head all the way back to the left while charging the Speed Booster. Store a 
Shinespark just as you get to the room with the Cacatac in the middle. Spin 
jump to the center and destroy it, then pre-open the door to the left and 
Shinespark through the next room to get back to the Red Tower. Climb up the 
shaft using wall jumps and the Ice Beam, then continue climbing while freez-
ing the Rippers as platforms to get to the very top. In the Hellway, jump 
and damage boost off two sets of ceiling spikes to quickly cross the room, 
then head into the next area and shoot down through the floor to reach a 
green door. Take this path and damage boost across the spikes to collect the
[POWER BOMB TANK (1/1)]. Return the way you came, set a Power Bomb on the 
way up to get rid of the yellow door, and climb up to take the elevator back
to Crateria.

Crateria

Move off the platform and set a Power Bomb the yellow door (it is important 
to move first because you might accidentally make the elevator go back down)
then go through the door, setting another Power Bomb before climbing to 
reopen it from the other side. Go all the way up and kill the Kihunters, 
then open the Power Bomb Door to the right. Go left to get enough running 
room, then turn back and short charge the Speed Booster to store a Shine-
spark before entering the next room. Spin jump slightly across the water and
release a charged shot right as you descend from the peak, then engage the 
Shinespark to cross the rest of the Moat, pick up the final [MISSILE TANK 
(5/5)] of the run, and continue across. If you timed the shot correctly, the
door will have opened and you’ll continue to fly across the ocean all the 
way to the green door.

Wrecked Ship

Head all the way to the bottom, morphing and shooting the floor to reach the
room below you. Bomb the wall to the very right and head to the eye door, 
then head inside and fight Phantoon using the Doppler technique while hoping
for good RNG and a one-round kill. Once Phantoon is dead, exit and head back
up to the main area. Go up through the maze you entered and take the door to
the left to reach the last [SUPER MISSILE TANK (2/2)] of the run, then con-
tinue all the way up, using the kago trick to pass through some of the plat-
forms. Once in the Attic, use a Power Bomb on the enemy cluster here, kill 
what the Power Bomb didn’t get and head to the left, killing the remainder 
so you can open the far-left door. Go back outside of the Ship and take the 
path along the ground to the first area you can shoot through. Go down 
through this maze to the right and follow the path until you find a room 
filled with spikes. Use long spin jumps to cross this room and morph into 
the Chozo Statue’s palm, then wait an eternity while it carries you to the 
room with the [GRAVITY SUIT]. Once you have it, exit the Wrecked Ship to the
left.

Crateria

Head all the way back the way you originally came up and go back down the 
door you pre-opened before with a Power Bomb to return to Brinstar.

Brinstar

Go back the same way you came to get here, damage boosting through the Hell-
way to avoid getting stuck, then drop all the way down through Red Tower to 
reach the bottom right. Continue going as if you were heading toward Kraid, 
but Power Bomb the glass tube to break open the path to Maridia.

Maridia

Climb up the first room and take the door in the ceiling. From here climb 
and wall jump up to reach the second door on the right, then go straight up 
and wall jump off the right-hand tower to reach the door in the ceiling. 
Charge the Speed Booster going to the right and diagonally Shinespark up to 
reach the next door, then shoot the blocks in the floor and continue heading
to the right to reach a large open room. Set a Power Bomb to destroy part of
the floor, drop down, then wall jump up the left-hand wall and use the door 
up here to reach the Mochtroid room. Shoot out the breakable walls, then use
the Speed Booster to get the rest of the way which takes you to Botwoon’s 
room. Once Botwoon is defeated, head to the right and use a spin jump into a
mid-air morph to tuck into the tunnel to grab the final [ENERGY TANK (4/4)],
then drop back down and use the Speed Booster to charge past the quicksand 
and through the blocks. Keep the boost going into the next room, then store
your Shinespark in here and quickly single wall jump up the right-hand wall
to the next door. Make a short spin jump to clear an overhang, then activate
the Shinespark to perform the Full Halfie across the room and drop down to 
the red door at the bottom. Enter here and drop through the false floor to 
the Gadora, then head inside to fight Draygon. Destroy the turrets with 
three Missiles each, then kill Draygon with X-Factors and a Shinespark to 
trigger a Bluesuit. During the death animation, convert the Blue Suit into a
Sparksuit, then go to the left and collect the [SPACE JUMP]. Now Space Jump 
out of the room and go back the way you came to the large grapple room, 
climb to the top, then use your Sparksuit’s stored Shinespark to cross the 
room again.
Drop down to the left in the vertical room and take the now-flashing door 
into the maze-like room filled with Cacatacs. Refill Super Missiles as need-
ed and take the door at the upper left, then go through the next door at the
bottom left and cross the quicksand. In this next room, you can either use 
the Speed Booster to charge a Shinespark and try to quickly make it to the 
top to Shinespark up to the area with the overhang (this is very difficult) 
or just climb out of the water and Space Jump up. Climb the next vertical 
room with the Space Jump and head to the right into the room with the 
[PLASMA BEAM] at the bottom-right corner. Destroy all the Space Pirates in 
the room to exit, then go back the way you came, using a Moonfall to quickly
reach the bottom of the vertical room to get back to the sandy area. Now 
climb up and head to the right, using the green door in the floor to access 
the large Maridia Pipe, which takes you to a room leading down to a hallway.
Bomb through the floor and head left while running to make fast Space Jumps
across the Evir room. Go through the next door, then fall through the hole 
in the floor and continue going left to reach the green gate and an exit 
from Maridia that places you back in Brinstar.

Brinstar

Take the path to the right and use the elevator to return to Norfair.

Norfair

Drop down and take the same path you did before to the Ice Beam, but Power 
Bomb through the floor and head to the left. Go through this room and Moon-
fall down in the next room. Speed Boost down this long access tunnel and 
Speed/Space Jump through the next long room, skipping the Energy Recharge 
and continuing to Space Jump through the long grapple room. This takes you 
to a blue gate; shoot it and roll through a hole in the wall to drop down to
a room with a Power Bomb Door. Open it and then damage boost off the Viola
circling the bottom platform to fling yourself into the large lava-filled 
room to the left. Once you land, Space Jump up to the right to reach the 
entrance to Ridley’s Lair and take the elevator down.

Ridley’s Lair

When you reach the bottom, you’ll take the right-hand path since we’re skip-
ping the Screw Attack. In the room with the Pirates, Power Bomb the floor, 
go down and to the right to find a door, then short charge the Speed Booster
and Shinespark through the next room to reach the aptly-named "worst room in
the game". The Space Pirates in here can only be killed with Screw Attacks,
which you don't have, so you have to climb up with wall jumps while avoiding
them. Use a Power Bomb halfway up to blow away part of the ceiling, and keep
wall jumping past the Pirates and Namihes, finishing with a tricky mid-air
morph over the head of the one at the top. Make a Space Jump into the Amphi-
theatre and try to keep Space Jumping along the perimeter of the stalactite 
so that you can start ascending immediately on the other side. Take the path
up and to the right, take the door to the right, then shoot through the 
floor and make your way down past all of the Red Kihunters to the bottom. 
Power Bomb through all of the obstacles and keep going to the right, then go
down and to the left through a tunnel to reach a room with many Dessgeegas. 
Power Bomb them to get them out of the way, and use another to blow up the 
path leading down, then turn off the Spazer and Ice Beams.
Kago through the platforms by taking spike damage, and head into the room at
the bottom to reach the two Metal Pirates.  Short charge the Speed Booster 
and scroll them off the screen, then go back and Shinespark diagonally up so
that your echoes kill them, and continue to the left. Run through the lava 
in the next room and keep going left through the next room using speeding
Space Jumps to get through faster. At the end of the path is the Gadora; hit
it with a Super Missile and go in to fight Ridley. Kill Ridley with X-Factor
attacks, then re-equip Ice and Spazer, using charged Beams while baiting him
into his pogo attack for free damage. Once he's dead, exit the room and take
the path you came all the way back to the room where you shot through the 
floor. Now go to the right and up past the Funes and take the path to the 
left, going through the next room and up past the Dragons to the door at the

upper left. Quickly get across the area with the rising lava tide and fire
straight up to kill the Red Kihunters above you as they inflict a ton of 
damage. Take the door at the upper left and follow the path past the crumble
blocks and barriers that you have to Bomb through to reach the exit out of 
Ridley’s Lair back to an upper part of Norfair.

Norfair

This places you adjacent to Bubble Mountain, so take the path through the 
door and go through the floor to the area with the two doors, taking the one
on the left. Jump across the gap and Speed Boost through the rocks and 
enemies to get back to the main shaft with the elevator. Climb up and take 
the elevator back to Brinstar.

Brinstar

Return to the room with the broken tube and take the path into Maridia.

Maridia

Take the same path you did the first time through to reach the large open 
room. Space Jump to the top-middle and take the upper path out of there, 

through the hole in the wall to reach an area leading to a green gate. Shoot
it and progress back out of Maridia to the top of Red Brinstar.

Brinstar

Take the path out of the wall back up the elevator into Crateria.

Crateria

Go all the way up, to the left, refilling at your ship if need be (it might 
be smart to take a slight time loss to ensure you have enough ammunition 
stock), then head left into the caves, taking the same path you did to 
Brinstar the first time. At the bottom of the path with the Space Pirates, 
take the red door on the right and Speed Boost through the room to reach the
G4 Statue. Wait for it to sink into the ground, then take the new path down 
the elevator into Tourian.

Tourian

Drop down and head left through the Metroid rooms while trying to group them
together so you can save on ammunition. You need an absolute minimum of 15 
Missiles and 10 Super Missiles when you finish the Metroid rooms (or a com-
bination thereof, you can have 20 and 8, or 25 and 6, etc). This is the 
reason this safer route picks up extra Missiles. Clear all four Metroid 
rooms and drop down into the sandy area, proceeding left. Once you get into 
the room and the Baby Metroid attacks, perform the Baby Skip trick using 
counterclockwise jumps to get around its swoops. If it captures you, remove 
Varia and let it drain your health faster, then use the refill station in 
the next room, but optimally you want to get past without getting grabbed. 
In the next room fall down and head right to the Gadora, which takes you to 
the final vertical room before the Mother Brain. Drop down and head to the 
left, performing the Zebetite skip so you can progress straight to Mother 
Brain. Break the tank with six Missiles, then perform a short hop spin jump 
to get stuck in the tank and pump her full of Super Missiles until she is 
killed. For the final fight, avoid her attacks while firing only charged 
Wave+Ice+Plasma Beams at her head. At 17 hits she’ll use her fire beam and 
at 22 she’ll prepare to use Hyper Beam, so just relax at this point. As long
as you have about 350 HP you’ll be fine. Wait out the whole cutscene until 
you get the Hyper Beam, then spam Mother Brain with 29 shots to kill her.
When the escape sequence starts, go left and down through the door, then 
take the next door at the bottom right. Fall to the bottom and charge the 
Speed Booster, using a Shinespark to reach the upper right. In here climb 
up, then go to the right and fall, then Space Jump up the left-hand wall to 
reach the ledge at the top. Here, Speed Boost out of the room, through the 
Pirates and the blocks to reach the main Craterian shaft.

Crateria

Right below the right below the first platform, store a Shinespark and then
use it diagonally up to the right to sail all the way to the top. Climb out 
of here to the top, ignore the critters and race to your Ship to end the 
game.

This route ideally finishes the game in about 55 minutes of real time and 
should give you an item percentage of 24%. Of course once you are practiced 
enough you can drop the extra safety Missile Tank and Energy Tank for 22%. 
The next section will cover the PRKD route which skips most of those safety 
items along with the Space Jump and Plasma Beam.

## 8C. Any% PRKD Route

This section will be added later, after I have become proficient enough at it
to write a quick little guide. This will eventually follow the same structure 
at the KPDR Any% route, with very short paragraphs dictating movement and very
little covering any of the movement tricks. General movement here is based off
of ShinyZeni's 40:22 world record and Oatngoats' previous 40:36 record and the
route only allows for one additional safety Missile Tank for a total of 20/10.
During this route you will be collecting only the following items: 4x Missile 
Tanks, 3x Energy Tanks, 2x Super Missile Tanks, 1 Power Bomb Tank, the Morph-
ing Ball, Bombs, Charge Beam, Gravity Suit, Spazer, Ice Beam, Hi-Jump Boots, 
Speed Booster, Wave Beam, and Varia Suit for a grand total of 20%. The run be-
gins when you touch down on Ceres.

Space Colony

From the start, Moonfall to the first door. Proceed through the remaining 
rooms and get Ridley to deplete your health down to 29 HP. Exit the Space 
Colony the same way you came in, using damage boosts to cross the large room
with falling tiles and use ledge grabs to quickly climb the first room back 
to the elevator.

Crateria

Once you arrive on Zebes and exit your ship, head left into the next room 
and go down the vertical shaft. In the Tourian shaft, Moonfall down the 
right-hand side and take the path at the bottom through the old Mother Brain
chamber to the elevator and take it down to Brinstar.

Brinstar

Head left to get the [MORPHING BALL], then head to the right and through the
floor to reach the first [MISSILE TANK (1/4)]. Collect it, then go back up, 
mid-air morphing through the left-hand path to return to the elevator. Go 
back up to Crateria.

Crateria

Kill the Space Pirates, then single wall jump up the Tourian Shaft. Return
to the first main room and drop into the tunnel, heading to the right to get
the [BOMBS] and fight Bomb Torizo. Kill it and exit via Alcatraz at the left
and bomb through the far left-hand wall. Head down the long tunnel for the 
first [ENERGY TANK (1/3)], then go past the Space Pirates and take the next 
diagonal path down to reach the elevator to Brinstar.

Brinstar

In Green Brinstar, take the right-hand path, killing enemies for Missile 
refills, then open the first red door on the right. Take a running spin jump
into the room and Mockball past the gates to climb up in the ceiling and get
the first [SUPER MISSILE TANK (1/2)], then drop back down and exit to the 
previous room. Fall and take the door at the bottom right, running through 
this whole room and bombing through the wall at the end. This takes you to a
large pink room; fall to the very bottom and grab the [MISSILE TANK (2/4)],
then set a Bomb by the block at the right corner and fall down into the room
to get the [CHARGE BEAM]. Climb back out, go up and over the obstruction and
use the green door. Head down through the room, Mockballing where necessary 
to pick up speed, and shoot through the blue gate. Collect Super Missile 
refills from the Cacatacs in the next room and speed across the Noob Bridge 
to reach the door leading to the red part of Brinstar.
This is the key area where KPDR and PRKD diverge. In KPDR you continue on
down to fight Kraid and get some items from Norfair, but in this one we are
going to go straight up Red Tower and proceed to the Wrecked Ship. Getting 
up Red Tower without the Ice Beam to freeze the Rippers takes a lot of
practice, but the first thing you have to master is the Hero Shot, where you
shoot a shot upwards, scrolling it just off the screen so it breaks the
block at the very top. Now carefully wall jump up past the Rippers to get
into the hole at the top and take the door into Hellway. Damage boost off of
the spikes to cross the room and take the next door, shooting through the
floor to reach a green door. Damage boost here off the Boyons to reach the
[POWER BOMB TANK (1/1)]. Return the way you came, set a Power Bomb on the 
way up to get rid of the yellow door, and climb up to take the elevator back
to Crateria.

Crateria

Move off the platform and set a Power Bomb the yellow door (it is important 
to move first because you might accidentally make the elevator go back down)
then go through the door, setting another Power Bomb before climbing to 
reopen it from the other side. Go all the way up and kill the Kihunters, 
then open the Power Bomb Door to the right. Since you don't have the Speed
Booster, you have to execute a Continuous Water Jump across the Moat. Make
the first long spin jump and grab the [MISSILE TANK (3/4)], then execute
the second wall jump off of the edge of the pedestal to clear the room. 
Head into the Ocean area and use spin jumps and wall jumps to cross the
platforms to reach the green door leading to the Wrecked Ship.

Wrecked Ship

Head all the way to the bottom, morphing and shooting the floor to reach the
room below you. Bomb the wall to the very right and head to the eye door, 
then head inside and fight Phantoon using the Doppler technique while hoping
for good RNG and a one-round kill. Once Phantoon is dead, exit and head back
up to the main area. Go up through the maze you entered and take the door to
the left to reach the last [SUPER MISSILE TANK (2/2)] of the run, then con-
tinue all the way up, using the kago trick to pass through some of the plat-
forms. Once in the Attic, use a Power Bomb on the enemy cluster here, kill 
what the Power Bomb didn’t get and head to the left, killing the remainder 
so you can open the far-left door. Go back outside of the Ship and take the 
path along the ground to the first area you can shoot through. Go down 
through this maze to the right and follow the path until you find a room 
filled with spikes. Use long spin jumps to cross this room and morph into 
the Chozo Statue’s palm, then wait an eternity while it carries you to the 
room with the [GRAVITY SUIT]. Once you have it, exit the Wrecked Ship to the
left.

Crateria

Head all the way back the way you originally came up and go back down the 
door you pre-opened before with a Power Bomb to return to Red Brinstar.

Brinstar

Go back the same way you came to get here, damage boosting through the Hell-
way to avoid getting stuck, then Moofall down the Ripper shaft and continue
heading all the way down through Red Tower to reach the bottom right. Keep
going to the right and shoot through the ceiling in the room with the Caca-
tac, then wall jump up and take the path to the green door for the [SPAZER].
Drop down and continue to the right all the way to the elevator room that
leads down to Norfair.

Norfair

Drop into Norfair, open the green door on the left and continue heading down
to the red door on the left. Run in here, grab the [ENERGY TANK (2/3)], then
kill the Sova and drop down to get the [HI-JUMP BOOTS]. Come out of this 
room and wall jump back up the narrow tunnel and mid-air morph into the top,
then exit the room. Drop all the way down to the third door on the left. 
Grab the [ENERGY TANK (2/3)] and kill the Sova before it goes offscreen to 
be able to open the unlocked door. Take the path down and enter the door to 
collect the [HI-JUMP BOOTS], then exit the room and wall jump back up the 
narrow shaft, mid-air morphing into the tunnel to reach the exit. Climb up 
to the green door on the left and open it, then Mockball past the falling 
gates to reach the next room. Cross the floating platforms into the zig-
zagging room and jump up while mid-air morphing to quickly reach the passage
that leads to the [ICE BEAM]. Exit the way you came, using a short hop Mock-
ball to get by the gates again, then exit the room to the elevator area and 
take the door directly opposite you, following the path until you reach the 
green Bubble Mountain area. Make a long wall jump off the second ledge to 
climb u and over the Cacatac, then take the upper right door into a room 
with three Metarees. Kill them and climb up through the ceiling and through 
the next door, running all the way down the diagonal slopes to the next room
to collect the [SPEED BOOSTER]. Speed Boost back out past the rising lava,
then use the Zeb nest nearby for a few refills - take whatever you get and
don't stay too long, then return to Bubble Mountain, dropping down and tak-
ing the bottom path. Follow this area and drop one level down to the next 
door, heading across the floating platforms to reach a ledge with the last
[MISSILE TANK (4/4)] that you'll pick up in this route. As the fanfare ends,
continue your dash off the ledge and spin jump across the room, wall jumping
up the right-hand wall to reach the red door. Head inside to grab the [WAVE 
BEAM], then exit this room and trek back across the large room back, taking
the blue door at the bottom.
Before continuing, go to the Inventory screen and deactivate the Spazer and
Ice Beams for later, then continue the downward path through the next blue
door and across the room with the spikes and platforms. Damage boost off of
the spikes to get through faster, and take the next blue door into a vert-
ical room with Funes on the wall. Fall all the way down, shooting through
the floor and go left through the lava to reach the vertical room that 
leads into the Lava Dive room prior to Ridley's Lair. Open the Power Bomb
door, kill the nearby Viola and short charge the Speed Booster, storing a
Shinespark just before you reach the lava. Damage boost off of the first
Namihe and fly backwards, then vertically Shinespark once you have enough
clearance to reach the top of the room. Go through the next door and take
the path down to Ridley's Lair.

Ridley's Lair

When you reach the bottom, you’ll take the right-hand path since we’re skip-
ping the Screw Attack. In the room with the Pirates, Power Bomb the floor, 
go down and to the right to find a door, then short charge the Speed Booster
and Shinespark through the next room to reach the aptly-named "worst room in
the game". The Space Pirates in here can only be killed with Screw Attacks,
which you don't have, so you have to climb up with wall jumps while avoiding
them. Use a Power Bomb halfway up to blow away part of the ceiling, and keep
wall jumping past the Pirates and Namihes, finishing with a tricky mid-air
morph over the head of the one at the top. Now do you like the Amphitheatre
that fills with lava as you climb to the top? I hope so because now you have
to make it through without the Space Jump. Fall down and quickly start going
up the platforms, jumping over the Space Pirates and doing whatever you can
to minimize being hit. Once you safely make it out, shoot through the floor
in the next room and make your way down past all of the Red Kihunters to the
bottom. Power Bomb through all of the obstacles and keep going to the right,
then go down and to the left through a tunnel to reach a room with a lot of
Dessgeegas. Power Bomb them to get them out of the way, and use another to
blow up the path leading down. 
Kago through the platforms by taking spike damage, and head into the room at
the bottom to reach the two Metal Pirates.  Short charge the Speed Booster 
and scroll them off the screen, then go back and Shinespark diagonally up so
that your echoes kill them, and continue to the left. Run through the lava 
in the next room and keep going left through the next room, killing any Zebs
and Violas for ammunition refills. At the end of the path is the Gadora; hit
it with a Super Missile and go in to fight Ridley. Kill Ridley with X-Factor
attacks, then re-equip Ice and Spazer, using charged Beams while baiting him
into his pogo attack for free damage. Once he's dead, exit the room and take
the path you came all the way back to the room where you shot through the 
floor. Now go to the right and up past the Funes and take the path to the 
left, going through the next room and up past the Dragons to the door at the

upper left. Quickly get across the area with the rising lava tide and fire
straight up to kill the Red Kihunters above you as they inflict a ton of 
damage. Take the door at the upper left and follow the path past the crumble
blocks and barriers that you have to Bomb through to reach the exit out of 
Ridley’s Lair back to an upper part of Norfair.

Norfair

This places you adjacent to Bubble Mountain, so take the path through the 
door and go through the floor to the area with the two doors, taking the one
on the left. Jump across the gap and Speed Boost through the rocks and 
enemies to get back to the main shaft with the elevator. Climb up and take 
the elevator back to Brinstar.

Brinstar

Head to the right, blasting the Super Missile blocks and take the path to
Kraid's Lair.

Kraid's Lair

Enter and proceed through the network of rooms. In the room with the Kihunt-
ers, shoot through the floor to reach the gauntlet to Kraid. Kill the Space 
Pirates and Mini-Kraid, collecting refills, then head through the next room 
and damage boost off the spikes to reach the Gadora. Kill it and head in to
fight Kraid, using the stunlock quick kill. Once he's dead, go and collect
the [VARIA SUIT], then go back out the way you came back to Brinstar.

Brinstar

Exit the lair and use a Super Missile to get back across the gap, then head
back to the left to the glass tube and set a Power Bomb to break it, which
takes you into Maridia.

Maridia

Climb up the first room and take the door in the ceiling. From here climb 
and wall jump up to reach the second door on the right, then go straight up 
and wall jump off the right-hand tower to reach the door in the ceiling. 
Charge the Speed Booster going to the right and diagonally Shinespark up to 
reach the next door, then shoot the blocks in the floor and continue heading
to the right to reach a large open room. Set a Power Bomb to destroy part of
the floor, drop down, then wall jump up the left-hand wall and use the door 
up here to reach the Mochtroid room. Shoot out the breakable walls, then use
the Speed Booster to get the rest of the way which takes you to Botwoon’s 
room. Once Botwoon is defeated, head to the right and use a spin jump into a
mid-air morph to tuck into the tunnel to grab the final [ENERGY TANK (3/3)],
then drop back down and use the Speed Booster to charge past the quicksand 
and through the blocks. Keep the boost going into the next room, then store
your Shinespark in here and quickly single wall jump up the right-hand wall
to the next door. Make a short spin jump to clear an overhang, then activate
the Shinespark to perform the Full Halfie across the room and drop down to 
the red door at the bottom. Enter here and drop through the false floor to 
the Gadora, then head inside to fight Draygon. Destroy the turrets with 
three Missiles each, then kill Draygon with X-Factors and a Shinespark to 
trigger a Bluesuit. During the death animation, convert the Blue Suit into a
Sparksuit and exit the room with a long spinning jump into a wall jump to 
get up to the flashing door. 
Now climb back up to the Colosseum, then reach the top and use your stored
Shinespark to get back across the room. Drop back down the vertical room and
head left back through the quicksand room and backtrack all the way through
Botwoon's room, through the Mochtroid area, and into the large open room.
Set a Bomb at the right-hand corner and fall through the floor to reach the
left-hand door, then backtrack left, up through the ceiling, and left again
to reach Mt. Everest. Make a long spinning jump in this room to reach the 
platform in the center and take the door in the ceiling. Follow this path
up and over to the left to reach a hidden Morph Ball tunnel that takes you
to a green gate and the exit to Maridia which places you at the top of the
Red Tower in Brinstar.

Brinstar

Take the nearby elevator back up to Crateria.

Crateria

Go all the way up, to the left, refilling at your ship if need be (it might 
be smart to take a slight time loss to ensure you have enough ammunition 
stock), then head left into the caves, taking the same path you did to 
Brinstar the first time. At the bottom of the path with the Space Pirates, 
take the red door on the right and Speed Boost through the room to reach the
G4 Statue. Wait for it to sink into the ground, then take the new path down 
the elevator into Tourian.

Tourian

Drop down and head left through the Metroid rooms while trying to group them
together so you can save on ammunition. You need an absolute minimum of 15 
Missiles and 10 Super Missiles when you finish the Metroid rooms, so just
keep that in mind that if you don't have these numbers when you exit Metroid
room 4, you won't have enough ammunition to kill Mother Brain. Once you get
to the sandy area, proceed left to reach the area where the Baby Metroid 
attacks. Perform Baby Skip using the clockwise Stashio method and get into 
the next room to take the door at the bottom right. In the next room fall 
down and head right to the Gadora, which takes you to the final vertical 
room before the Mother Brain. Drop down and head to the left, performing the
Zebetite skip so you can progress straight to Mother Brain. Break the tank 
with six Missiles, then perform a short hop spin jump to get stuck in the 
tank and pump her full of the rest of your ammo until she is killed. For the

final fight, avoid her attacks while firing only charged Spazer+Wave+Ice 
Beams at her head. This fight takes longer than Any% KPDR since you don't 
have Plasma, but just hang in there. At or around 46 hits she’ll use her 
fire beam and at 62 she’ll prepare to use Hyper Beam, so just relax at this 
point. As long as you have about 350 HP you’ll be fine. Wait out the whole 
cutscene until you get the Hyper Beam, then spam Mother Brain with 29 shots
to kill her.
When the escape sequence starts, go left and down through the door, then 
take the next door at the bottom right. Fall to the bottom and charge the 
Speed Booster, using a Shinespark to reach the upper right. In here climb 
up, then go to the right and fall, then Space Jump up the left-hand wall to 
reach the ledge at the top. Here, Speed Boost out of the room, through the 
Pirates and the blocks to reach the main Craterian shaft.

Crateria

Right below the right below the first platform, store a Shinespark and then
use it diagonally up to the right to sail all the way to the top. Climb out 
of here to the top, ignore the critters and race to your Ship to end the 
game.

This route ideally finishes the game in about 47 minutes of real time and 
should give you an item percentage of 20%. The top level play of this run
currently has a world record of 40:22 set by ShinyZeni and involves far 
more technical skill than this simple walkthrough provides. If you still 
crave a challenge after this, Low% is your option, but this guide will not
be covering it as it's something I've not practiced.


# 9. Item Locations:

The 100% version of the speedrun itself covers the location of each individual 
item in the game, but a section is provided here in case you find yourself miss-
ing an item. It is first broken down by Item Category, then further subdivided 
into the regions of Zebes. There are 100 items total in the game, and each item
counts as 1%. In total, there are:

46x Missile Tanks
+  16x Suit Upgrades
+  14x Energy Tanks
+  10x Super Missile Tanks
+  10x Power Bomb Tanks
+   4x Reserve Tanks
100 Items

Your endgame item total include 230 Missiles, 50 Super Missiles, 50 Power Bombs,
and 18 Energy Tanks (14 regular + 4 Reserve Tanks). The remaining Power Suit 
upgrades are split across different categories and round out the total. Read 
below for a comprehensive listing of each item in the game, broken down by type
and then by planetary region.

## Energy Tanks (14)

You have a maximum total of 14 Energy Tanks. Each Tank you acquire adds 100
units of energy to your meter.

Crateria (2)

 -  ENERGY TANK #01
As you make your way towards Brinstar, you'll see this one in plain
sight directly in front of you in the first diagonal room.

 -  ENERGY TANK #02
This is in a large cave accessible from the Landing Site. Using a wrap-
around shot, you can horizontally Shinespark through the entire room to
find this one near a Chozo statue.

Brinstar (5)

 -  ENERGY TANK #03
After beating Kraid, you will see a flashing door as you exit his lair.
Enter it and use Bombs to destroy the Beetoms, then fire at part of
the ceiling to reveal this Tank.

 -  ENERGY TANK #04
This is near the first green jungle tunnel. Drop to the bottom here and
set a Power Bomb to break apart the floor, then drop down another tunn-
el to reach another room with Beetoms. Bypass it to reach a metallic
area. Run and spin jump as soon as you see this Tank to grab it and
clear a hole in the floor. Super Missile Tank #03 is in the next
room, so grab it as well.

 -  ENERGY TANK #05
This is by the large pink room above the Charge Beam. Open the yellow
door with a Power Bomb and wall jump up to the blue gate. Shoot it,
then drop into the room on the other side to grab this Tank.

a new passage, then use the Speed Booster to blast through a set of
Boost Blocks to reach this Tank.

After you've defeated Crocomire, either use a horizontal Shinespark or
running spin jumps and a single wall jump to reach this Tank across the
lava pit.

 -  ENERGY TANK #10

to find another door that leads to a large watery room. Use the left-
hand wall to single wall jump up to reach the Chozo statue holding it.

Maridia (2)

 -  ENERGY TANK #13
This is in the large vertical room with the Tatori. Pre-open the door
that leads in here, then Speed Boost in and hold the charge right be-
fore you reach the edge. Spin jump out, straighten out, and Shinespark
vertically. Hold right as you fall to land on the Grapple Block holding
this Tank.

 -  ENERGY TANK #14
This is in the room after you defeat Botwoon and can be gotten from
either side, depending on your route. Its easiest to spin jump and use
a mid-air morph to get it from the left, but again, the route dictates
when it's picked up either before or after Draygon.

## Reserve Tanks (4)

You have a maximum total of 4 Reserve Tanks. Each Tank you acquire will give
you an extra capacity of 100 units of energy, but they need to be filled up
first and set to Auto Mode to be used automatically.

Brinstar (1)

Maridia (1)

 -  RESERVE TANK #4
Starting in the large area that lies before the first area with the 
Mochtroids, use Bombs to get through part of the floor at the right,

crumble blocks, and use the Spring Ball to reach this Tank (along with 
Missile Tank #46).

Maridia (8)

 -  MISSILE TANK #39

shoot through the ceiling to reach a new path. Go through the door and 
race past the collapsing bridges to find this upgrade at the end.

 -  WAVE BEAM
From Bubble Mountain, take the lower of the two paths at the top. Go
into the next red door, spin jump across the floating platforms and open
the blue gate. Run off the ledge to the right and single wall jump up to
reach the room with this upgrade.

 -  ICE BEAM
From the elevator room, take the first door on the right. Use a Mockball
to get past the gates, then head to the left to the room with the Funes.
Spin jump up into the passage to the right, mid-air morphing to fit into

the Morph Ball passage, then take the tunnel to reach the room with this
upgrade.

 -  GRAPPLING BEAM
After skipping Crocomire, head to the left into the next room, then go 
through the floor. Drop all the way down and use Power Bombs to clear 
the rubble away, then use a Speed Booster-powered spin jump across the 
chasm to reach the room with this upgrade.

 -  SCREW ATTACK
You'll get this in the next room after defeating the Golden Torizo.

Wrecked Ship (1)

 -  GRAVITY SUIT
After defeating Phantoon, access the upper levels of the Wrecked Ship 
and take the paths through the rock to get back inside. Find the Chozo 
statue and morph into its palm to let it carry you as it walks back 
across to reveal a hidden path. At the bottom, head through the door to 
the left to find this upgrade.

Maridia (3)

 -  SPACE JUMP
You'll find this in the room to the right after defeating Draygon.

 -  SPRING BALL
From the large room prior to the first section with Mochtroids, sink in-
to the first quicksand pit at the bottom. Sink into the next one to 
reach a long hallway with Evirs, then head to the right. Bypass the room
with the Grapple Block and go to the right. Shoot through the ceiling
and freeze a Puyo so you can kago through the ledge above you. Now take
the door and Power Bomb the metal obstruction away to let the Shaktool
carve a path through the sand to the room this is in. To get it, use the
left-hand set of tunnels.

 -  PLASMA BEAM
Once Draygon is defeated, get to the large Maridia Pipe that connects 
the two sectors, then go to the upper left area to find a door on an 
underhang. Space Jump to this door, then go up and to the right to reach
a large room with the upgrade at the bottom right corner.


# 10. Miscellaneous Tricks:

SUPER METROID has a few interesting things here and there besides what's been
already covered in the walkthrough. There are numerous glitches that you can
play with if you're bored enough, some of which are pretty interesting. Some
can break the game or cause graphical screw-ups; others give you more to play
around with. Some of the glitches are included here, along with a few other
small tidbits.

 - Skip Ammo and Energy Recharge Station Scenes

This is a quick little speed trick that saves seconds if you have to use
an Energy or Ammo Station. Press Start just as you plug in, then return to
the game. You can move even while your stocks are being replenished, and
head out of the room to continue. You can do this with Map Stations, too,
although you won't download the map data for some reason.

 - Break into the Wrecked Ship Early

Ever notice that there are two entrances to the Wrecked Ship? The second 
one is accessed from Maridia, so there should be no way for you to get 
there without first having the Gravity Suit, but in fact, there is. All
that is required is Power Bombs and the Ice Beam. To do it, enter Maridia 
the normal way via the glass pipe. Make your way through the first vert-
ical ascent into the next room. Enter the red door on the right and open
the green gate. Keep going to the right into the next room that has the
broken pipe. This leads into the first of the two long quicksand hallways
with the Evirs. Carefully jump (don't spin jump here as your trajectory is
too wild) from platform to platform to reach the end (if it's too trouble-
some, consider using the Ice Beam to freeze the Evirs so you don't have to
contend with them shooting at you), which takes you to the entrance of the
Maridia Pipe, the large purple shaft that connects the north and south 
sectors. Use a Power Bomb to break part of the ceiling, and jump up to the
door leading to the Pipe, which will drop you off in the sandy area that 
the Plasma Beam is located in. Travel through this sandy room to reach a 
blue door on the other side, then quickly jump to the middle of the quick-
sand to avoid being grabbed by a Yapping Maw and jump to the other side 
with the door. Jump into it to avoid another Yapping Maw, then enter the 
next room to reach the vertical area that leads up to Crateria. Climb this 
area and use the Ice Beam at the top to freeze the Rippers, then enter the 
Craterian cave. There is a part in the ceiling you can shoot just before 
the water begins, so you can still jump up into it. Get out of the Morph 
Ball maze, head to the crumble blocks, and hold right while falling to land
on solid ground. Bomb Jump to the next ledge, then you can access the blue
door that takes you up higher. Climb this shaft and head outside to a lake
that will take you to the Wrecked Ship. This part is the easiest to cross;
just run through the water, making long spin jumps over the walls to get
to the far left. Spin jump up to the next platform, then jump at the 
ledge up to your right. You should emerge out of the water long enough to
do a quick wall jump that will drop you on the ledge by the door leading
into the Wrecked Ship. 
Doing this, though, makes the game act a bit funky. For starters, the game
designers never intended for you to get here without already having beaten
Phantoon, so there are no "before battle" triggers here. The rooms are
powerless, but there is no water to be found in any of the areas. Also, 
the Energy Tank that the Chozo statue holds doesn't even appear at all.
The only way to trigger these to appear is to go down and fight Phantoon,
after which point all the rooms activate like normal. It's a pretty inter-
esting thing to mess around with if you're bored.

 - Gold Torizo (GT) Code

There exists in the game a debug code that can be triggered before fighting
the Gold Torizo in Ridley's Lair. It can be performed from either side; the
only requirement is that Gold Torizo be alive. When entering the room the
normal way, you need to hold all of the face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) until
the frame that the game checks for the inputs during the horizontal door 
transition (basically when the screen goes black and starts to move). If 
coming from the Screw Attack room, it is a little more particular as the
buttons need to be held on the 26th frame, but this is still easily accomp-
lished by holding all four buttons for the duration. When the screen does 
the transition, release the buttons and you'll see the following inventory
effects immediately. This code overwrites anything you had before in favor
of its new matrix, so if you had anything over the amount, you will lose
those items.
A. Samus' energy is set to 700. You'll have seven Energy Tanks with the 
last one only having 1 unit, and 3 full Reserve Tanks for a total of
300 HP.
B. You will have 100 Missiles (20 Tanks), 20 Super Missiles (4 Tanks), 20
Power Bombs (4 Tanks).
C. You are given every suit upgrade in the game except the Screw Attack.
If you come in the back way you cannot grab Screw Attack on the way,
because this code will take it away again. Additionally, the icons for
them won't display but you are given Grappling Beam and X-Ray Scope.
Saving/reloading fixes this.
D. All items will be simultaneously equipped; if you plan on continuing
to play you must go and deactivate Spazer or Plasma or else your first
shot will crash the game.
Using this code to overwrite existing inventory, it is possible to then get
every other item in the game and come out with a maximum of 135%, which is
actually the basis of its own speedrun category called Max% GT Code. The
reason the max is 135% is because the game will not give you credit for any
items that cannot ordinarily be picked up twice, i.e. two Plasma Beams will
still be 1%. Now to do this means you have the unenviable task of reaching
Golden Torizo with only 1 tank each of Missiles, Super Missiles, and Power
Bombs, while picking up no Energy Tanks or Reserve Tanks. But hey, if you
wanted, you could do this to get 135%, then trigger Spacetime Beam (below)
and go collect all 100 again for a cool 235%...if you're that bored. Now,
for obvious reasons the use of this code is not permitted in standard 100% 
runs, but there are glitch categories, one of them being "100% GT" that 
is allowed to use GT Code and pick up the remaining items to reach 100%. 
The YouTube channel GoldenChorizo Code has a fantastic explanation of this,
a guide on how to get to GT for 135%, and plenty of other videos covering
niche Super Metroid content.

 - Glitched Beams

This is probably the most famous of the potential game-breaking glitches.
There are three variations of this trick - the Spacetime Beam, the Murder
Beam, and the Chainsaw Beam. All three glitched beams are triggered in the
same fashion where you take advantage of a situation where you can equip
the Spazer and Plasma Beams simultaneously. Ordinarily this will completely
crash the game when firing a shot, but you can achieve different results 
by utilizing them in specific manners. To set up the conditions for these,
go to the Inventory screen and make sure you have all of the Beam weapons
and at least one of the Boot upgrades. Move the cursor to the Boot upgrades
section, and simultaneously press Left and A. One of three possible things
will occur.
A. The boot upgrade you selected turns off; you hit A too early.
B. Spazer turns off and Plasma turns on; you hit A too late.
C. Spazer and Plasma both activate and "VAR" appears; you did it correct.
What is happening here is an overflow glitch; the "VAR" that appears is
just cut off text from the right side of the screen for "VARIA". Now, how
you utilize this glitched scenario is the basis of the three glitched beam
states, which are detailed below.

1. Spacetime Beam

Using this glitch has the capability to fully reset the game to the orig-
inal starting conditions while keeping current inventory intact - all of
the bosses respawn and all doors reset to their original state. There are
only certain areas you can do this glitch in, specifically areas where 
the available screen size is very large - 25 screens counting empty map
tiles, to be specific. This means that you can use the Craterian shaft 
adjacent to old Tourian, Big Pink in Brinstar, or Crocomire Speedway once
you are directly above the door in the floor. Of these three, the shaft
in Crateria is the best option. Using this area as a guide, go into the
horizontal room with the Boyons to the right of the main shaft, then turn
left and face the door. Go to your inventory and unequip the Wave Beam,
then perform the glitched beam setup. Once Spazer and Plasma are active
and "VAR" appears, return to the game and fire an uncharged shot. This
immediately causes the inventory area at the top of the screen to become
garbled and the framerate crashes. Move left through the open door, and
once on the other side, the framerate fixes itself, the door will become
yellow and you'll see the pre-Morph Ball mist. At this point, in order to
continue you'll have to return to your inventory and remove the Spazer so
the game doesn't crash again. But you can now go about trekking through
the whole planet again and achieve a max possible 200%, or you can even 
go up to Crateria and leave via your ship, which triggers a new condition
where you restart the game and see the opening cinematic again. What's 
funny in this one is that Samus' Gravity Suit will be fully colored dur-
ing the black and white parts, and after this is over you'll land back on
the Space Colony - a true New Game+!

2. Murder Beam

This glitch causes a ball of energy to fire and remain onscreen, dealing
constant damage in a vertical pattern to anything that comes in contact
with it, but like the Spacetime Beam, it has very limited application. 
One of the best areas to try this trick is in the second Mother Brain
fight since you have the vertical tiles loaded around you to handle the
overflow. Once Mother Brain is onscreen, stand underneath her and set up
the same glitched beam trick except this time you have to charge a shot
before you go to the subscreen and you'll keep Wave Beam equipped. When
you trigger the "VAR" overflow and return, Samus should look like she is
charging a black beam. Firing this leaves the ball in place and Mother
Brain will consistently take damage while you're free to do other things.
Once the Murder Beam has been used, go to the inventory and fix the beam
glitch to continue normally. Another enemy you can try this on is Gold
Torizo, but it should be said that these methods are far slower than the
normal speedrun methods.

3. Chainsaw Beam

This glitched beam state is probably the oddest of them all. It results
from a combination of Wave, Spazer and Plasma being equipped - Ice and
Charge must be turned off or the game will crash. This glitch can open
doors and destroy blocks that you can usually destroy just with the Power
Beam, but it has a peculiar nuance in that it can cause damage to enemies
but only during a Power Bomb detonation. Using the Beam generates no on-
screen effect, but it will inflict seven hits at 150 damage apiece per
Power Bomb, and it inflicts Super Missile-type damage only if the enemy
is at extremely close range. Additionally, when the Power Bomb is deploy-
ed, it can destroy Power Bomb blocks (but not open doors), and it will 
cause framerate issues and screw up the Power Bomb graphics. If you use 
Chainsaw without a Power Bomb, the effects are minimal as it only affects
blocks and doors that are opened with the Power Beam.

 - Glitchomire

Crocomire's pretty fun to mess around with. If you get the Plasma Beam
before fighting him, you'll literally fragment him into pieces. This is 
because Crocomire isn't one single sprite - he's made up of multiple ones 
that glitch out if you fight him in a way you're not meant to. Use the Game

Genie code to turn on the Hyper Beam, and it'll be one shot, one kill as
he'll just backpedal continuously into the lava. Plasma does this too if
you hit him square in the mouth. Another thing that people may not know,
that further delves into how Crocomire is assembled from different sprites,
is that his tongue is a separate "enemy" that has, surprisingly, 32,767 HP,
and it can only be hurt with Power Bombs. Power Bombs themselves enrage
Crocomire and he tends to just stomp forward until you crash into the wall
of spikes, but he can be manipulated a bit if you have Plasma Beam which
calms him back down, or sends him careening backwards into the lava (kind
of like what's employed in the 100% strategy). Using various cheats or just
being patient and refilling from projectiles, you can use a total of 83 
Power Bombs to destroy Crocomire's tongue, at which point his AI gets a bit
weird. But, when you make him fall into the lava, sure enough, his tongue 
will be gone. Poor Crocomire - he did nothing wrong!
